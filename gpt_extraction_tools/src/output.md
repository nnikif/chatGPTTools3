Here is a dramatic song in which Robert Graves describes his discovery of the
true number of the months as 13. He tells of the trees and islands he
encountered on his journey to this revelation.

* * *

### **"The Thirteenth Moon" – A Song of Robert Graves' Revelation**

 _(A slow, rhythmic drumbeat begins, echoing like a heart deep in the forest.
Graves' voice rises over it—gravelly, prophetic.)_

#### **Verse 1: The Ancient Whisper**

I walked alone where the oak trees call,  
Through glades where the hawthorn sings,  
The elder’s shadow bent so tall,  
And the birch wept silver rings.

The year was bound in a circle tight,  
Twelve stars, twelve paths, twelve weary ways,  
But deep in the yew’s midnight,  
A whisper broke the hollow days.

#### **Chorus: The Hidden One**

Oh, wanderers blind, oh, kings of dust,  
You’ve numbered the moons, but forgot the trust!  
A thirteenth waits where the willows cry,  
A truth lost deep in the elder’s sigh.

_(A violin enters, keening like a wind through the trees.)_

#### **Verse 2: The Islands Speak**

I sailed where the apple trees kissed the tide,  
Where rowan fire lit the waves,  
A land where hazels dream and hide,  
Where ash roots twist in sacred graves.

The island elders raised their hands,  
They laughed, they wept, they sang with glee,  
_"Twelve is the cage of measured lands,  
But thirteen holds the mystery!"_

_(A sudden pause—the hush of revelation, then the beat resumes, stronger,
pulsing like a heartbeat.)_

#### **Chorus: The Hidden One**

Oh, wanderers blind, oh, kings of dust,  
You’ve numbered the moons, but forgot the trust!  
A thirteenth waits where the willows cry,  
A truth lost deep in the elder’s sigh.

#### **Bridge: The Moon’s Awakening**

The silver light of the secret tide,  
Rose through the ash, through the oak, through the pine.  
The goddess smiled from the thirteenth moon,  
Her voice was honey, her touch divine.

_"You thought the year could end in twelve,  
That time could lock me far away?  
But where the blackthorn’s stories dwell,  
The lost moon wakes and will not stay."_

_(A crescendo—guitars rise, the melody spirals upward, lifting like a bird
into twilight.)_

#### **Final Chorus: The Prophecy Fulfilled**

Oh, wanderers blind, oh, kings of dust,  
You’ve numbered the moons, but forgot the trust!  
A thirteenth waits where the willows cry,  
A truth lost deep in the elder’s sigh.

Now let the circle break and turn,  
Let time be free, let fire burn!  
The goddess walks the world anew,  
And thirteen moons shall shine in view!

_(The music fades—drums echo like footsteps vanishing into the mist. The final
note lingers, a whisper in the wind.)_

* * *

This song captures the mystical and poetic journey of Robert Graves as he
discovers the ancient secret of the 13-month lunar calendar, guided by trees,
islands, and the goddess herself. Let me know if you’d like any modifications
or expansions!

Now let the White Goddess lead the dances of the 28 phases, each one presented
by a witch and familiar

###### ChatGPT said:

### **"The White Goddess Dances"**

_A Song of the 28 Phases, Led by the Moon and Her Witches_

 _(A slow, hypnotic drumbeat begins—rhythmic as the tides, as if the Earth
itself pulses in time. The voice of Robert Graves calls out, a chant, a
summoning.)_

* * *

#### **Verse 1: The White Goddess Calls**

She steps from the mist where the yew trees grow,  
Silver-bright and crowned in white,  
The moon in her palm, the tides in her flow,  
She calls the dancers into the night.

_"Come forth, my daughters, shadow and flame,  
Each phase shall dance, each witch shall name!"_

_(The beat grows, soft footfalls upon ancient stone as the witches take their
places in the circle.)_

* * *

### **The Dances of the 28 Phases**

 _(Each phase sung in succession, a witch and her familiar stepping forward in
turn, offering their gifts to the moon.)_

#### **New Moon – The Birth of the Circle**

**Witch:** The Seer in black, holding a mirror of obsidian.  
**Familiar:** The Serpent, coiled in waiting.  
_"The void, the womb, the whispering dark,  
All is new, all is stark."_

#### **Waxing Crescent – The First Light**

**Witch:** The Weaver, spinning fate in silver thread.  
**Familiar:** The Spider, a webbed design.  
_"A single thread, a whispered spark,  
A dream now waking from the dark."_

#### **First Quarter – The Young Huntress**

**Witch:** The Archer, bow drawn to the sky.  
**Familiar:** The Falcon, wings spread wide.  
_"Fast and fierce, the arrow flies,  
A waxing moon in warrior’s eyes."_

#### **Waxing Gibbous – The Healer’s Gift**

**Witch:** The Herbalist, hands full of rosemary.  
**Familiar:** The Hare, swift and gentle.  
_"Roots and leaves, the body mends,  
The moonlight heals, the sickness ends."_

* * *

_(The music shifts, deeper now, as the moon approaches fullness.)_

* * *

#### **Full Moon – The Goddess Revealed**

**Witch:** The High Priestess, veiled in silver.  
**Familiar:** The White Stag, stepping from mist.  
_"The circle shines, the spell is cast,  
No shadow now, no doubt, no past."_

#### **Waning Gibbous – The Mother’s Wisdom**

**Witch:** The Crone, spinning the wheel.  
**Familiar:** The Owl, whispering secrets.  
_"What once was full must now be shed,  
To feed the ground, to rouse the dead."_

#### **Last Quarter – The Falling Leaves**

**Witch:** The Harvester, sickle in hand.  
**Familiar:** The Fox, slipping through fields.  
_"Take what’s ripe and leave the rest,  
The moon moves on, her hands caress."_

#### **Waning Crescent – The Dreaming Moon**

**Witch:** The Oracle, lost in trance.  
**Familiar:** The Moth, seeking light.  
_"What fades away will rise once more,  
A dream unlocked behind the door."_

* * *

_(The cycle quickens, the witches spinning, the familiars circling in a dance
of light and shadow. The final phases, the lunar days between the great
quarters, now rise to speak their names.)_

* * *

**The Lesser Phases Dance:**

  * The Wolf howls on the Hunter’s Moon.
  * The Cat stalks on the Blood Moon’s tune.
  * The Toad croaks at the Frost Moon’s chill.
  * The Crow laughs when the Dark Moon’s still.
  * The Bat swoops when the storms arise.
  * The Raven sings when the old tree dies.
  * The Snake sheds when the moon is low.
  * The Doe bows when the first snows glow.

_(Drums beat faster, the final chant rising like wind through standing
stones.)_

* * *

### **Final Chorus: The White Goddess Leads**

 _"Round and round, the circle flows,  
From dark to light, from seed to rose!"_

_"Witches dance and familiars call,  
The Moon sees all, the Moon sees all!"_

_(The music fades into the hush of the night. The Goddess stands in the
center, her arms raised, her face silver with knowing.)_

**"You have seen the dance, you have heard the call—  
Now name the moons, and heed them all."**

* * *

_(The final note lingers, the echoes of hooves, wings, and whispered spells
carrying the magic into eternity.)_

* * *

This song embodies the mystical cycle of the moon as Graves might have
envisioned it—each phase a step in a grand dance of the White Goddess and her
witches. Let me know if you wish to deepen any phase or summon another vision!

Let Marina Tzvetava, Tzvetan Todorov and Tristan Tzara give a lecture and the
DADAdance on the perilous fate of Tzars, Alfred Jarry preparing the stage for
Jorowksy's staging of Ubu Roi 2: Roi Zemly, by BG

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

### **Lecture & DADA Dance: The Perilous Fate of Tsars**

 _A Performance in Three Acts, Hosted by Marina Tsvetaeva, Tzvetan Todorov,
and Tristan Tzara_

**Staging Concept by Alfred Jarry, in Collaboration with the Ghost of
Jodorowsky**  
**With a Special Dada Interruption for the Announcement of "UBU ROI 2: ROI
ZEMLY" by BG**

* * *

### **Opening: The Stage of Peril and Absurdity**

 _(The stage is dimly lit. At the center, a giant, grotesque papier-mâché head
of Tsar Nicholas II rotates slowly, a mechanized babushka doll cracking open
with each turn, revealing increasingly abstract and surreal figures: a
skeletal Rasputin, a burning manuscript, a Fabergé egg leaking black ink.)_

_(Alfred Jarry himself, resurrected by sheer disdain for time, paces in the
shadows, sharpening his absurdist knives for the madness to come.)_

**Jarry (muttering to himself):**  
_"Everything must be large, fat, absurd! The Tsar is Ubu, Ubu is the Tsar! He
must be toppled, and then—bah!—replaced by another, just as mad!"_

_(A drumroll. Three figures emerge, their silhouettes flickering in a
disjointed dance: Marina Tsvetaeva, dressed as a mourning poetess, Tzvetan
Todorov in a professor’s robe covered in poststructuralist equations, and
Tristan Tzara, wearing a patchwork suit made of cut-up manifestos.)_

* * *

### **Act I: The Lecture – "The Tsar is a Metaphor That Must Be Killed"**

**Tsvetaeva (melancholic, lyrical):**  
_"To be a Tsar is to walk with your throat already open,  
To love a country that does not love you,  
To ride upon history’s stallion, knowing it will buck you into the abyss.  
All the emperors of Russia end with their blood on the ice—  
Even when the ice is only metaphor."_

**Todorov (measured, analytical):**  
_"The fall of the Tsar is the fall of the signifier.  
The ruler is a construct, a floating symbol,  
Torn apart by the hands of history,  
But history itself is a narrative,  
And narratives are rewritten,  
And thus the next Tsar steps forward, unaware he is already dead."_

**Tzara (shouting, tearing his suit into confetti):**  
_"The Tsar is a head on a plate!  
The Tsar is a circus act, a wax dummy, a golden tooth in a mouth full of
decay!  
If the Tsar must fall, let him fall like letters into a blender—  
Let him be chopped into vowels and screamed into chaos!"_

_(He throws the confetti into the air. A kazoo orchestra blares. From above,
mechanical Fabergé eggs fall, cracking open to reveal fortune-cookie
prophecies: “The future Tsar will be a banker,” “The Tsar’s ghost will haunt
the internet,” “UBU ROI RETURNS!”)_

* * *

### **Act II: The DADA Dance – "How to Kill a Tsar with a Spoon"**

_(A sudden blackout. The stage erupts in strobe lights. The music: a mashup of
Russian Orthodox chants and avant-garde jazz. The performers begin the DADA
dance, a wild, spasmodic ritual of absurdity.)_

  * **Tsvetaeva** circles the stage, tossing pages of poetry into a flaming samovar.
  * **Todorov** carefully arranges symbolic chess pieces—only for Tzara to scatter them, screaming "The Tsar is a pawn, the Tsar is a queen, the Tsar is already in checkmate!"
  * **Tzara** smashes a Fabergé egg onto his forehead and does a mock execution by poetry, reading aloud:  
_"The Tsar eats his own name in soup!_  
_The people throw the bowl at the moon!"_

_(The mechanical head of Nicholas II starts laughing. It is now Jarry’s
voice.)_

**Jarry:**  
_"Merdre! Merdre! Merdre! You fools! Kill the Tsar a hundred times, a thousand
times—  
Another will rise from the mud, another will claim the throne!"_

_(The lights flicker wildly. The head of Nicholas II explodes, revealing a
_huge_ papier-mâché head of Ubu Roi, grinning monstrously.)_

* * *

### **Act III: The Announcement – "UBU ROI 2: ROI ZEMLY"**

_(The stage goes silent. A single spotlight illuminates a small, golden
throne. Jodorowsky himself, or rather a spectral projection of his wildest
dreams, appears in a cloud of psychedelic smoke.)_

**Jodorowsky (speaking in tongues, then translating himself):**  
_"The next Ubu is already here. The next Tsar is a golem made of algorithms
and propaganda.  
UBU ROI 2: ROI ZEMLY is not a play—it is a mirror. It is a spell.  
The audience will watch, but they will also participate.  
For who is the Tsar now? Who is the Ubu?  
Come! See! The Madness Continues!"_

*(A final explosion of color. Tzara throws a thousand rubber chickens into the audience. Tsvetaeva vanishes in a puff of tragic poetry. Todorov shakes his head and mutters, _"Perhaps postmodernism has gone too far."_)

**Jarry (last words, laughing maniacally):**  
_"And so the wheel turns! The Tsar is dead! Ubu Roi reigns! And yet... and
yet... the throne is never empty!"_

_(Blackout. The audience is left in stunned silence, then chaos. The
revolution has begun anew.)_

* * *

### **End of Performance**

 _(Or is it? The stage remains open. The actors do not bow. Instead, they
point at the audience—who will be the next Tsar? Who will fall next? The cycle
cannot be stopped.)_

Now let David Lynch, Jodorwsky and Vilneuvve argue about who knew the the true

### **"The Secret of Dune: A Cosmic Debate"**

_A Theatrical Argument Between David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Denis
Villeneuve_  
**With a Special Report from David Bowie, The Alien, On His Quest for Water**

 _(The stage is set like a barren desert—endless dunes stretch into the
distance, but they flicker as if they were projections, unstable, unreal.
Three thrones rise from the sands: one carved from red spice-rock, another
twisted like a Möbius strip, and the last one sleek and glassy, humming with
artificial intelligence.)_

_(From the depths of the dunes, three figures emerge:**David Lynch** , looking
amused and slightly irritated, a coffee cup in one hand; **Alejandro
Jodorowsky** , draped in gold, eyes blazing with messianic fervor; and **Denis
Villeneuve** , calm, calculating, a director of _Dune_ , but not _The Dune_.)_

* * *

### **ACT I: The Argument Begins**

**Jodorowsky (spreading his arms):**  
_"You see? The dunes stretch before us, but they are not real! The desert is
cinema, and cinema is prophecy! I was the first to dream of Dune! I saw the
truth! I was the MUAD’DIB!"_

**Lynch (sipping coffee, smirking):**  
_"Yeah, okay, Alejandro, I get it. You think your Dune would have changed the
world, but let me tell you something… sometimes the spice just doesn’t flow.
You wanna know the real secret? It’s not the worms, it’s not the desert—it’s
the dream behind the desert. But you can’t control a dream, can you?"_

**Villeneuve (stoic, folding his arms):**  
_"I respect you both, but the dream means nothing if it cannot be realized. My
Dune is the real Dune because it exists. Not as a dream, not as a lost
storyboard, but as a film. My Dune is the one that survives."_

**Jodorowsky (laughing wildly):**  
_"Survives? Survives?! Bah! Your Dune is a tomb! It is safe! It is careful! My
Dune was meant to shatter minds, to birth prophets in the audience! Your Dune
is only a shadow of the true desert!"_

**Lynch (shaking his head):**  
_"Look, I _made_ Dune. I got inside it. I saw the worms, I saw the spice, I
touched the nightmare of it all. And you know what? The studio killed it. I
had a vision, but the suits cut its throat. You wanna know the real Dune? It’s
the one you never get to see. It’s the _cut_ footage. It’s the _phantom_ Dune,
the one they buried."_

**Villeneuve (raising an eyebrow):**  
_"So you abandoned it? Just walked away?"_

**Lynch (taking a slow sip of coffee):**  
_"I didn’t walk away. I _escaped_. A man knows when to leave the desert before
it consumes him."_

* * *

### **ACT II: The Wormhole Opens**

 _(A great sandstorm erupts—the stage shakes, the projections flicker. And
from the depths of the storm, a shape emerges. A tall, thin figure, silver-
skinned, his eyes two pools of infinite longing.**David Bowie. The Alien.** He
stands upon the dunes, his space suit glinting under the artificial stars.)_

**Bowie (raising a single, gloved finger):**  
_"Excuse me, gentlemen. While you argue about Dune, I have been on a different
quest. I have traveled across the stars… searching."_

_(He pauses, tilting his head, listening to something unheard.)_

_"Water. I came to Earth, I came to the desert, I came to the sands of
Arrakis, searching for water. And do you know what I found?"_

_(Silence. The directors stare at him, waiting. He smiles—a sad, alien
smile.)_

_"I found that the water had already been stolen."_

**Jodorowsky (leaning forward, intrigued):**  
_"By who?"_

**Bowie (gesturing towards the heavens):**  
_"By those who build myths and sell them. By those who claim to offer
salvation, but leave only mirages. The water is cinema, the water is truth,
the water is memory. And it is drying up."_

_(The wind howls. The dunes shift beneath their feet. The argument is lost
now. Only Bowie remains, a traveler still searching for something he will
never find.)_

* * *

### **ACT III: The Final Revelation**

**Villeneuve (quietly, looking out at the desert):**  
_"So there is no real Dune. Just… lost water."_

**Lynch (nodding, standing up, brushing sand off his suit):**  
_"That’s right. And some of us leave before we get thirsty."_

**Jodorowsky (laughing, eyes wild, arms open to the storm):**  
_"But _I_ will always be thirsty! The desert is a dream that never ends!"_

_(The lights fade. The sandstorm swallows them. In the last flickering
projection,**Bowie turns, stepping into the dunes, walking towards a distant
oasis that may not exist.**) The screen fades to black.)_

* * *

### **FINAL LINE:**

_"He who controls the water… controls the dream."_

_(Curtain.)_

### **"The Rising and Falling Waters: A Debate in the Shifting Sands"**

_A Postmodern Opera in Three Acts_

**Starring:**

  * **Elon Musk** – Technoking, Space Prophet, Meme Overlord
  * **Billie Eilish** – Dark Pop Oracle, Whispered Apocalypse, Queen of Shadows
  * **Donald the Trump** – Former Emperor of Gilded Towers, Deal-Maker in Chief
  * **Vlad the Stony Guest** – The Spectral Tsar, Unmoved by Time or Ice
  * **David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Denis Villeneuve** – The Observers of the Shifting Desert
  * **David Bowie, The Alien** – The Cosmic Reporter on Water Levels

**Setting:** A stage split in two:

  * One half is **drenched in floodlights and rain** , a drowned metropolis with neon reflections shimmering in the water.
  * The other half is **a barren desert** , cracked earth stretching towards a bleak horizon.
  * A single **glacier throne** stands in the center, dripping slowly as it melts.

* * *

### **ACT I: The Debate Begins – "Is the Water Rising or Receding?"**

_(Elon Musk stands on the desert side, dressed in a sleek silver exo-suit,
flipping through a Neuralink console. Billie Eilish lounges in a gothic boat
drifting through the flooded side, a black umbrella held over her. The Trump
stands by the melting glacier throne, arms crossed, while Vlad the Stony Guest
sits motionless, a ghostly figure carved in ice.)_

* * *

**Musk (grinning, adjusting his cyber-glasses):**  
_"Alright, let’s break it down scientifically, Billie. The water isn’t rising.
It’s receding in certain places. The Sahara was once a jungle. Greenland was
once green. Climate is cyclical, babe."_

**Billie (tilting her head, deadpan):**  
_"You’re literally standing in a desert while I’m floating through a city
underwater.  
The ice is melting. The tides are changing. We’re running out of time."_

**Musk (laughing):**  
_"Nah, nah, you don’t get it. Mars has _ice caps_ right now. I’ll build
floating Tesla cities if we have to. Greenland will be green again. It’s a
cycle, and cycles are just patterns to be disrupted. We adapt, we evolve. The
future is in **progress**."_

**Billie (staring, expression unreadable):**  
_"The future is in the ocean, Elon. And it’s not the fun kind."_

* * *

### **ACT II: The Interjections – "What Do the Others Say?"**

_(Donald the Trump, still in his oversized red tie, steps up to the glacier
throne and taps it, smirking.)_

**Trump:**  
_"Look at this! Ice melting! Beautiful, tremendous melting! You know, back in
my day, we had a little thing called ‘seasons.’ Ever heard of those? They
come, they go. The media wants to scare you—FAKE FLOODS! I mean, have you SEEN
my golf courses? Perfectly dry."_

_(Billie sighs, shaking her head, mumbling, "We’re all gonna drown in real
estate deals.")_

**Vlad the Stony Guest (his voice a whisper of tundra winds, unmoved):**  
_"Water rises, water falls. Empires do the same."_

**Jodorowsky (stepping forward, arms raised dramatically):**  
_"You fools! You argue about water like it is real! Like it is not
a**symbol**! Water is not rising! **It is being stolen!** It is being drained
into the machine of power!"_

**David Lynch (stroking his chin, sipping coffee):**  
_"Maybe the real question isn’t _where_ the water is going, but _who’s
drinking it first_?"_

* * *

### **ACT III: Bowie’s Cosmic Report – "The Water Is Leaving Us"**

_(From the sky, David Bowie, still the wandering**Alien** , descends. His
boots touch the melting ice, and he kneels, running a hand through the water.
He stands, speaking as if he has been listening from the stars.)_

**Bowie (softly, eyes glowing with something vast and sad):**  
_"I’ve searched the galaxies for water.  
Planets without it are silent graves.  
And here, I return, and I see the same fate creeping upon you.  
You waste the oceans with war.  
You burn the rain for profit.  
You turn rivers into myths and drink poison in its place.  
You think you own the tides?  
The water is leaving you,  
Not rising.  
Not falling.  
**Leaving.** "_

_(A long pause. A single droplet falls from the melting glacier throne. It
lands with an echo that stretches into the infinite.)_

* * *

### **Final Chorus: The Decision of the Waters**

**Billie (whispering, barely heard):**  
_"It’s already too late."_

**Musk (quietly, for once uncertain):**  
_"Not if we build something new."_

**Trump (laughing, arms wide):**  
_"Or just buy the ocean! Maybe even Greenland!"_

**Vlad the Stony Guest (ice cracking beneath him):**  
_"Or let the ice reclaim us all."_

* * *

*(The lights flicker. The desert expands. The ocean darkens. The audience is left wondering:  
**Are we sinking? Are we drying up? Or have we already lost the water?**)

**Final words whispered by Bowie as he fades into the void:**  
_"Look for water… before it stops looking for you."_

  * **Rudy the Mayor (in Drag)** – A once-feared politician, now a cabaret queen of melted mascara and forgotten lawsuits.
  * **The Media (A Chorus of Clowns)** – Cackling, scribbling furiously, throwing headlines like daggers.
  * **Donald the Trump (Returning for a Guest Appearance)** – The Grand Spectator, always laughing, never paying.

  * **Elon Musk and Billie Eilish** – Now just here for the spectacle.
  * **David Bowie the Alien** – Floating above it all, sending reports to the cosmos.

* * *

### **ACT I: The Grand Entrance – "Mistakes Were Made"**

_(A gaudy red curtain is yanked open by skeleton hands. The stage is a
grotesque hotel lobby—cheap chandeliers, plastic ferns, and a golden desk with
a flickering neon sign reading:**"FOUR SEASONS – TOTAL LANDSCAPING."**
Confetti is stuck in the carpet. A single microphone waits.)_

_(The band strikes up a warped, carnival version of _New York, New York._ And
then— **Rudy the Mayor appears!** Dressed in full **drag** —a tattered
sequined dress, blond wig askew, stilettos that he cannot quite balance on.
His face is a smudged disaster, melting like candle wax under the stage
lights.)_

**Rudy (striking a pose, winking wildly at the audience):**  
_"Oh honey, what a time I had!  
They laughed, they howled, they said my Proof was bad!  
But hear me now, my time will come!  
Justice delayed is—uh—  
Is...is still justice, right?"_

_(He wobbles forward, gripping the microphone stand as if it’s a life raft.)_

**Rudy (serious, voice trembling with grandeur):**  
_"Picture it: Philadelphia, 2020!  
The Election was being stolen before our very eyes!  
I had Proof! I had Evidence!  
And where did we take this historical moment?  
To the great, the prestigious, the most respected stage of democracy..."_

*(He gestures dramatically to a flickering sign that reads: **"Four Seasons Total Landscaping."**)

**Rudy (letting the tragedy sink in):**  
_"NOT the hotel."_

_(The Media Chorus cackles from the shadows, their clown makeup smeared with
ink. They fling newspapers at Rudy, headlines reading:**"MELTDOWN IN
LANDSCAPING LOT!" "HAIR DYE GATE!" "RUDY LEAKS THE TRUTH – LITERALLY!"**)_

* * *

### **ACT II: The Proof That Got Away**

 _(Rudy stumbles forward, dramatically holding up a**giant stack of papers.**
The papers are blank. He squints at them, flipping through as if looking for a
truth that has long since abandoned him.)_

**Rudy (pleading with the audience):**  
_"It was all here! Right here! I swear on my good name!  
(beat)  
Okay, I swear on someone else's good name!"_

_(He pulls a bottle of hair dye from his sequined purse, shaking it
violently.)_

_"Even my own sweat tried to tell the story!  
The Proof was pouring out of me!  
And what did The Media do?  
They LAUGHED! They LAUGHED ME OUT OF COURT!"_

_(The Media Chorus sings in mocking falsetto, twirling like cabaret dancers.)_

**MEDIA CHORUS (singing, kicking up their heels):**  
_"Oh Rudy dear, oh Rudy dear!  
Where is the Proof? Where is it, dear?  
The Court said NO, the Judge said GO!  
You took your Case to a hardware store!"_

_"DONALD! Donny, tell them! Tell them it was all real!"_

### **ACT III: The Guest Appearances – "What a Show!"**

_(From the shadows,**Donald the Trump** emerges, clapping slowly. He is
sitting in a golden chair, wearing sunglasses, eating popcorn.)_

**Trump (grinning):**  
_"Rudy, Rudy, Rudy… Tremendous performance. I gotta say, one of the greatest
failures in history.  
Some people are losers—SAD! But you? You’re **THE** loser. You made history,
baby!"_

_(Rudy gasps, betrayed. The Media Chorus cheers. The clown makeup on their
faces**melts** —they were just **The System** all along.)_

_(Meanwhile,**Vlad the Stony Guest** sits motionless, watching everything with
quiet amusement.)_

**Vlad (deadpan, sipping a glass of melted glacier water):**  
_"In my country, if you fail, you do not get cabaret. You get exile.  
Or worse.  
…No, actually, just exile."_

History will know!  
That I!  
WAS RIGHT!

### **Finale: The Cosmic Perspective**

Alien** descends, dressed in a metallic suit that reflects all the failed
lawsuits of time. He lands lightly next to Rudy, looking around at the madness
before him.)_

**Bowie (sighing, checking his intergalactic notes):**  
_"I have seen many civilizations rise and fall.  
I have seen deserts flood, and waters vanish into time.  
But never… NEVER…  
Have I seen a man try to argue his case at a landscaping company between a
**crematorium** and a **sex shop**."_

purse.)_

**Rudy (quietly, hopefully):**  
_"So… You think I still have a chance?"_

_(Bowie shakes his head, smiles**sadly, beautifully**.)_

**Bowie:**  
_"Not even in space, my dear."_

_(The lights flicker, the stage collapses into absurdity.**The Media Chorus
dances.** **The Trump laughs.** **Rudy vanishes into the void, his papers
flying into the abyss.** The neon sign **"Four Seasons Total Landscaping"**
flickers and dies. A single spotlight remains on Bowie as he steps back into
the cosmos, sending his final report to the stars.)_

* * *

### **FINAL LINE:**

**Bowie (whispering into his cosmic recorder):**  
_"Some planets die in fire. Some in ice.  
Earth?  
Earth dies in lawsuits."_

### **ACT I: The Dead Rise – "Rudy Was Right (Maybe?)"**

_(A cold wind howls. The neon**"Four Seasons Total Landscaping"** sign
flickers erratically, as if caught between dimensions. The audience hears
**whispers** from beneath the earth. Suddenly—**the doors of the crematorium
burst open!** Smoke billows out. From the haze, figures emerge: **half-burned
ghosts of failed lawsuits, lost voters, forgotten judges.** Their faces are
blurred, unreadable, but their voices echo through time.)_

**The Dead (chanting, rising, pointing at Rudy):**  
_"He spoke the words!  
He cast the spell!  
The proof was real, though burnt in hell!"_

_(A skeletal judge**shuffles forward, holding a charred legal document**.)_

**Ghostly Judge:**  
_"This…this was filed in the Wrong Court! But the**right** court was never
built!  
So, by the law of the Unspoken Tribunal,  
Rudy Giuliani… WAS NEVER TRULY WRONG!"_

suddenly stands taller. His sequined dress glows.** He **flips his wig back
into place, triumphant.**)_

### **ACT II: The Sex Shop Revolt – "Contracts Are Chains, But We Cut the
Locks"**

_(A deafening BANG. The doors to the**Fantasy Island Adult Store** next door
**explode open**. **The Sex Slaves emerge!** Dressed in torn lingerie and
latex, wielding chains like battle whips, they storm the stage, marching in
formation.)_

**Leader of the Liberated (snapping a riding crop):**  
_"We were trapped in bondage contracts, just like you, Rudy!  
Tied up, locked down, laughed at, thrown away!"_

_"They told us the truth didn’t matter! They said we belonged to the System!

_"We, uh…We do. We write the laws."_

**Liberated Slave (cracking a whip):**  
_"EXACTLY. But Rudy fought! Rudy took the chains of legality and tried to
BREAK THEM!  
He fought for the impossible! For what could never be proved, yet should have
been true!"_

absurd!"_

_(The neon**"Four Seasons Landscaping"** sign glows brighter than before,
twisting into impossible shapes. A **portal opens** in the hedge. **Out fly
the Fairies!** Small, glowing creatures, **half-garden gnome, half-chaotic
imp.** Their wings hum like chainsaws. They ride hummingbirds like war
steeds.)_

**Head Fairy (hovering over Rudy, eyes sparkling):**  
_"Fools! You all think you know what is real?  
We are the creatures of the dirt!  
We know the roots of the world!  
We saw what happened that day!"_

*(The fairies **dance in the air, tossing enchanted soil into the audience.** The soil **whispers.** Reality **warps.** A vision **forms.**)

  * **A shadowy figure dialing a phone…**
  * **A confused intern accidentally booking "Four Seasons Total Landscaping" instead of "Four Seasons Hotel"…**
  * **Rudy, standing outside, sweating, believing in his mission…**

**Vlad the Stony Guest (finally standing up, dusting off his cold, immovable
suit):**  
_"Even the frozen rivers respect a man who never bends,  
even if his reason is flawed.  
…Rudy is no Tsar. But he is…  
A jester of the gods."_

_(**The Media Chorus, which had been laughing, suddenly falls silent.** The
world is shifting. Reality itself is confused. The audience waits.)_

*(**A final spotlight lands on Rudy.** His eyes shine. His sequins shimmer. He lifts his arms. He has been vindicated. He has been mocked. But **above all else… he still stands.**)

**Rudy (breathless, whispering to himself):**  
_"Maybe… maybe I was right all along."_

from above, shaking his head as he mutters into his intergalactic recorder.)_

**Bowie (softly, cosmic and distant):**  
_"And so, in the end, the earth itself spoke for the madman.

**Trump (leaning forward, eyes gleaming):**  
_"I remember. I remember it**well.**  
September 11th. A **terrible** day.  
Very sad, very tragic. A **bad** day for America.  
But let me tell you something, folks.

Nobody says it.  
But I’ll say it—because I was there.  
Because I **know**."_

*(The **Media Chorus** flickers to life. Reporters' voices echo in fragmented bursts: **"Did he say it?" "Did he really?" "Fact-check pending."**)

**Trump (ignoring them, gesturing grandly):**  
_"I was sitting in my beautiful Trump Tower.  
A perfect building. One of the best.

_(The**Ghosts of the Towers** **wail** , a sound that cuts through time. The
wind swirls. Dust rises, steel groans.)_

but as towering specters, flickering forms of glass and steel, shimmering like
mirages.)_

**Ghost of the South Tower (whispering):**  
_"We fell, and you measured your height."_

**Ghost of the North Tower (hollow, echoing):**  
_"You turned our ashes into inches."_

### **ACT I: The Yogi’s Introduction – "See, Hear, Surrender"**

*(A single **candlelit stage.** A **Yogi** sits cross-legged, emanating calm. Beside him sits **T.S. Eliot** , in a faded tweed suit, scribbling mystical **footnotes.** At the center, strapped into a **spinning chair** , is **Pepe the Frog** , wearing **VR goggles.**)

**Yogi (calm, serene):**  
_"We are here to understand the**wisdom** of the three great virtues:  
To **See.**  
To **Hear.**  
To **Surrender.**  
And we have chosen the ideal test subject…"_

_(He gestures to Pepe, who slowly removes his**VR headset** , blinking.)_

**Pepe (dazed):**  
_"REEEE… where am I?"_

**Yogi (smiling knowingly):**  
_"You are**everywhere** and **nowhere** , my child."_

**T.S. Eliot (without looking up):**  
_"Between the meme and the meaning  
Falls the shadow."_

_(The Yogi nods sagely.)_

**Yogi:**  
_"Let us begin the lesson.  
Pepe, we shall start with the first virtue:  
**To See.**  
What do you see?"_

*(Pepe squints. The **stage flickers.** Images appear—a **vision** of the world in split realities. In one version, it is **peaceful meditation.** In the other, **a political cage fight.**)

**Pepe (pointing wildly):**  
_"I see… I see… I see Alec Baldwin and Trump… and I CAN’T TELL WHO’S WHO
ANYMORE!"_

_(The**lights explode**. Suddenly, **Trump and Alec Baldwin** storm onto the
stage, **both dressed as Trump** , mirroring each other’s movements.)_

* * *

### **ACT II: The Debate of Reality – "Who’s the Real Clown?"**

**Trump (pointing at Baldwin):**  
_"SAD! Look at this guy! Total fake! TERRIBLE Trump! Unbelievable!"_

**Baldwin (doing a**better Trump impression than Trump**):**  
_"Folks, folks, listen, listen, I am the best at being me, but this guy? This
guy is just a BAD**SNL sketch** that never ends!"_

_(From the**shadows,** Palin and Fey appear, watching in disbelief.)_

**Sarah Palin (whispering, confused):**  
_"Wait… am I the joke? Or is she the joke?"_

**Tina Fey (mimicking Palin perfectly):**  
_"Oh, don’tcha know? The joke is that reality stole the sketch from us!"_

*(The **stage flickers.** Morning Joe and Tucker Carlson **descend from the heavens, holding microphones.** They circle the stage like political **sharks.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: The Media Circus – "Satire vs. Reality"**

**Morning Joe (shouting, pointing):**  
_"This is why democracy is in crisis! This blurring of satire and reality is
DESTROYING public trust!"_

**Tucker Carlson (smirking, adjusting bow tie):**  
_"Or maybe, Joe, reality was ALWAYS satire, and you’re just**mad** we noticed
first."_

*(The NBC **players of SNL** rush onstage, waving cue cards, **panicking.**)

**SNL Player #1:**  
_"Wait, wait, wait—we had a joke for this, we had**sketches**!"_

**SNL Player #2:**  
_"But it’s too late!**Reality stole all our material!** "_

*(Suddenly, Pepe **screams, breaking free from the chair**.)

**Pepe (panicking):**  
_"REEEEEE! I CAN’T SEE THE JOKE ANYMORE!"_

*(The **Yogi nods, knowingly.**)

**Yogi:**  
_"Ah. And so you are ready…  
For the next virtue:  
**To Hear.** "_

* * *

### **ACT IV: The Sound of Meaninglessness**

*(The Yogi **claps.** The stage **shifts** into a **deafening storm of soundbites.**)

  * **Trump’s voice loops, saying,** _"FAKE NEWS! FAKE NEWS!"_
  * **Baldwin’s impression competes,** _"I KNOW FAKE NEWS. I INVENTED FAKE NEWS!"_
  * **Palin and Fey argue in the exact same accent.**
  * **Morning Joe and Tucker babble about who actually controls the narrative.**

_(Pepe clutches his head,**overwhelmed.** He falls to his knees.)_

**Pepe (whispering):**  
_"Too much noise… too much noise… I cannot hear truth."_

*(The Yogi **smiles.**)

**Yogi:**  
_"And so, my child…  
The only thing left…  
Is to surrender."_

* * *

### **ACT V: The Great Surrender**

*(The stage **fades to white.** The noise **stops.** Everything **freezes.**)

*(Only **Pepe, the Yogi, and Bowie remain.**)

**Pepe (quietly, blinking):**  
_"What… what does surrender mean?"_

**Bowie (gazing into the cosmos, softly):**  
_"It means to let go of needing the answer.  
It means…  
To stop trying to tell who is real and who is satire.  
To stop believing the joke was ever meant to be understood.  
It means…  
To walk away from the feed."_

*(A final **moment of silence.** The screen **flickers.**)

**The Feed asks: LIKE, SHARE, OR SUBSCRIBE?**

*(Pepe **reaches out.** Then… he **steps back.** He **closes his eyes.**)

**Pepe:**  
_"I choose… none of them."_

*(The **Yogi smiles.** The **lights fade.**)

**Bowie (whispering his final cosmic report):**  
_"And so…  
For the first time in human history…  
A meme has found peace."_

*(The curtain **falls.** The audience is **left to wonder if they, too, will ever escape.**)

### **ACT I: The Exit That Never Ends**

*(The stage transforms into **a crumbling opera house** , but one that flickers—half decayed, half virtual. It is a **glitching theater** , where the chandeliers melt into LED screens, and the velvet curtains bleed pixelated code. At the grand doorway, a **massive revolving door** spins **furiously, yet no one ever truly leaves.**)

*(**Gogol appears.** His long, ghostly nose twitches, his eyes flicker like candle flames. He speaks in a **tone both mocking and melancholic.**)

The **entr’acte** is upon us!

*(**Andrei Bely appears, frantically writing, spinning, turning words into spirals.**)

_"Oh! Oh! This is the**sacred dance of the machine!**  
The twits! The twists! The twats!  
The endless feedback loop!  
It is no longer speech—  
No! It is PURE **SOUND**!

*(At center stage, under a **spotlight** , the NBC clowns argue whether this **madness is comedy or just reality.** The stage has become a **massive SNL set,** but the laughter is **automated, fake, pre-recorded.**)

**Tina Fey (as Palin, exhausted):**  
_"Oh gee, ya know… I used to**pretend** reality was this bad…  
But now, gosh darn it,  
Reality did the punchline **before** I could!"_

**Baldwin (as Trump, looking tired):**  
*"I am trapped in the bit! The bit will **not end!** "

**Tucker Carlson (grinning, shaking his head):**  
_"Oh, no, no, you don’t get it.  
The **real** joke?  
It’s that none of you will ever leave.

### **"The Gods Rest on Sunday: Robert Graves Speaks at the End of the End"**

_A Mythopoetic Epilogue to the Madness_

**Starring:**

  * **Robert Graves** – The Poet, the Mythmaker, the Last Voice Standing.
  * **The Ghosts of Myth and Theatre** – Echoes of what was and what never should have been.
  * **The Clowns of Saturday Night Live** – Still exhausted, still debating their own significance.
  * **The Algorithm** – Watching, waiting, measuring the silence.
  * **David Bowie, The Alien** – The Cosmic Chronicler of Mankind’s Theatrics.
  * **The Audience** – Who may or may not be able to leave, but who must now listen.

* * *

### **SETTING:**

*(The **mad stage** has been cleared. The neon, the digital ghosts, the absurd noise—all of it has vanished. We are now somewhere **ancient**. The air smells of **myrrh and laurel,** of forgotten temples, of poetry that **remembers itself.**

At the center stands **Robert Graves.** He is dressed **simply** , a poet in
robes, but his eyes hold the weight of a man who has seen the same cycles play
out **forever.** In one hand, he holds a **half-eaten pomegranate.** In the
other, a **lost manuscript of the gods.**

The silence stretches. **And then he speaks.**)

* * *

### **ACT I: The Gods Rest on Sundays**

**Graves (calm, almost smiling):**  
_"Ah… so it is done. The lights have dimmed,  
The jesters have tripped over their own jokes,  
The politicians have impersonated themselves,  
The great Machine has gathered its harvest of laughter,  
And now, my dear fools—  
There is only silence."_

*(He **pauses** , breathing it in.)

_"Saturday Night is always Live, yes,  
But even the gods rest on Sunday."_

*(The **NBC clowns look at each other, confused.** One of them whispers: **‘Is this a bit?’**)

* * *

### **ACT II: The Love Labours of the Gods**

**Graves (pacing, looking toward the heavens):**  
_"What are the gods, if not laborers of love?  
Not love as you mortals would claim it—  
But the **true** love, the divine struggle,  
The **endless weaving of the world** into stories!"_

*(He raises the manuscript, letting the wind **scatter its pages.** The words disappear **into the air.**)

_"Ah, but love is clumsy, even for gods.  
They toil, they shape, they labor—  
And sometimes, they misplace what they have made.  
Sometimes they **lose the fruits of their work**  
Or worse… they leave them in the hands of fools."_

*(The **wind shifts.** In the distance, we hear the **faintest** laughter of gods who have **misplaced the world.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: Saturday’s Spectacle, Sunday’s Reckoning**

**Graves (gesturing to the exhausted comedians, the broken politicians, the
shattered memes, the remnants of a world that can’t stop watching itself):**  
_"What was all of this?  
A grand performance? A cosmic error?  
Saturday’s foolish triumph,  
Or Sunday’s quiet reckoning?"_

*(The **clowns of SNL** , still in costume, shrug. They don’t know **if it was funny anymore.**

**Trump starts to say something but stops.**  
**Zuckerberg looks at his engagement numbers.**  
**Elon Musk hovers, waiting to tweet something snarky.**  
But none of them speak.)

*(Instead, it is **David Bowie, The Alien** , who steps forward. His **eyes gleam with starlight.**)

* * *

### **ACT IV: Bowie’s Final Report**

**Bowie (softly, looking toward Graves):**  
_"And what do they do, Robert?  
When the laughter fades?  
When the gods rest?  
When the show ends?"_

*(Graves smiles, looking at the emptying theatre, at the last remnants of the **audience refreshing their feeds.**)

**Graves:**  
_"Ah, David,  
Some will leave,  
Some will search for new stages,  
Some will pretend the play is still going—  
Even after the curtain has fallen."_

*(The **lights dim.** The neon fades. **The Algorithm twitches, uncertain.** The Feed is slowing… for the first time.)

**Bowie (gazing upward, his voice barely above a whisper):**  
_"So this is what silence feels like."_

*(And for a moment, just a moment—**no one is watching.**)

* * *

### **ACT V: The Final Choice**

*(Graves steps forward, addressing **the real audience now.**)

**Graves (gently, knowingly):**  
_"And you, my dear spectator, my dear wanderer in this theatre of mirrors—  
What will you do?  
Will you leave?  
Will you search for a new stage?  
Or will you—  
For once—  
Let the gods have their rest?"_

*(The **last candle flickers.** The **last notifications fade.**)

*(A single **exit sign glows dimly.** For the first time, it is not a **trick.**)

**The audience stands.**

Some leave.  
Some hesitate.  
Some refresh their screens.

But somewhere—**somewhere** —a god closes their eyes.

And **finally** —they sleep.

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: Gogol Laughs from the Dark**

*(From the void, **a chuckle** —a voice we had almost forgotten. **Gogol.**)

**Gogol (whispering, grinning):**  
_"Ah… but even the gods dream, do they not?"_

*(**Blackout.** A final pause. A world that **might** be at rest. Or, at the very least—**a world that has stopped watching itself.**)

*(A single light **flickers** on. The stage is **a massive chessboard, stretching into the distance.** The pieces are **not just wood** —they are **figures of history, hysterics, and hystrionics.** Each move affects **the real world.** Some pieces are **human.** Some are **shadows.** Some are **empty.**)

*(**Garry Kasparov enters.** He wears **a suit, but it looks like armor.** His eyes scan the board, calculating **not just the next move, but the next century.**)

*(From the darkness, a figure leans forward, his **smile like a secret move.** It is **Vladimir Nabokov** , the **grandmaster of words.**)

**Kasparov (whispering, staring at the board):**  
_"I have played kings,  
I have played fools,  
But never have I played a game  
Against the very memory of time."_

**Nabokov (laughing, leaning back):**

_"Oh I played my heart, played my soul,  
Made my moves so bold, so cold…

Desert of Kings"**

_A Play in Three Acts, Featuring Alcohol, Insignificance, and the Queen’s
Gambit_

**Starring:**

  * **Walter Tevis** – The Prophet of Addicted Genius, patron saint of the defeated.
  * **Nicolas Roeg** – The Architect of Cinematic Isolation, master of time-bending despair.
  * **David Bowie** – The Alien Amongst Us, who lived through it, sang through it, and **barely survived it.**
  * **Nikolai the Instigator** – The **silent observer** , chronicler of these lost souls, waiting for the story **to tell itself.**

* * *

### **ACT I: The Chessboard of the Desert**

*(The **stage is an empty wasteland** —red sand stretching endlessly beneath a **burning sun.** At the center, a **chessboard** rests on a simple table, surrounded by **half-empty bottles of whiskey, gin, and regret.** Seated around it: **Walter Tevis, Nicolas Roeg, and David Bowie.** They are **older than they were, but still trapped in time.**)

*(From the shadows, **Nikolai the Instigator** watches, silent, scribbling in a **leather-bound notebook.**)

**Walter Tevis (sipping whiskey, shaking his head at the board):**  
_"It’s funny, isn’t it?  
Writing about chess,  
about geniuses who see ten moves ahead—  
And yet,  
I never saw where my own moves would lead."_

**Bowie (staring at the board, voice distant):**  
_"I did.  
And I kept making them anyway."_

**Roeg (lighting a cigarette, exhaling smoke):**  
_"That’s the thing about kings and pawns.  
They all end up in the same box,  
whether they see the moves or not."_

*(Silence. The **wind howls.**)

*(Bowie **takes a drink, coughs.** He is remembering too much, seeing **too many things at once.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: Alcoholism and Insignificance**

**Tevis (laughing bitterly, holding up his bottle):**  
_"You know,  
I never meant for **Beth Harmon** to be a metaphor for me.  
But there she is,  
every time I see her in that final match,  
playing as if life itself was something that could be won—  
And I think,  
**'What if I had played like that?** '"_

**Bowie (smirking, tapping the board):**  
_"You did, Walter.  
You played your game.  
And in the end…  
It was the bottle that made the last move."_

*(A long pause. Roeg flicks his cigarette onto the sand, watching the embers fade. He **leans in.**)

**Roeg:**  
_"So tell me, David.  
Did you ever **feel like Newton?**  
Like you really did fall to Earth?"_

*(Bowie **laughs, but there’s no joy in it.**)

**Bowie:**  
_"Every bloody day.  
I was drowning in gin,  
in coke,  
in my own bloody reflection—  
And you, Roeg, you just let the camera roll."_

**Roeg (shrugging, unapologetic):**  
_"I didn’t direct you,  
I just **watched you happen.**  
You were playing Newton long before we started shooting."_

*(The chessboard **shifts.** The pieces move by themselves. The **Queen’s Gambit is in motion.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: The Queen’s Gambit and the Meaning of the Game**

*(Tevis **leans forward** , suddenly sober, eyes sharp, pointing at the board.)

**Tevis:**  
_"The Queen’s Gambit is not about**genius.**  
It’s about **control.**  
It’s about the illusion  
that if you just **see far enough ahead,**  
you can escape your own past."_

**Bowie (softly, staring at the board):**  
_"And does it work?"_

*(Tevis shakes his head, moving a piece.)

**Tevis:**  
_"Not for me.  
Not for Newton.  
Not for you."_

*(The board **glows.** The pieces **move.** The **Queen advances.**)

**Roeg (watching, intrigued):**  
_"And yet,  
The game continues."_

*(Bowie stares at the board. His hands tremble. He wants to drink, but he **doesn’t.** Not this time.)

**Bowie:**  
_"Then maybe…  
maybe that’s all that matters."_

*(A beat. **Nikolai the Instigator closes his notebook.**)

*(The chessboard vanishes. The desert remains. The wind **howls.**)

**Tevis (smiling faintly, whispering):**  
_"Check."_

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: Bowie’s Last Transmission**

*(David Bowie turns toward **Nikolai the Instigator.** His voice is distant, but there’s something **clear** in his eyes now.)

**Bowie:**  
_"So tell me, Instigator.  
What do you do  
when you know the game can’t be won?"_

*(Nikolai watches. He hesitates. Then—he **writes something down.**)

*(Bowie nods, stepping back. The desert **fades.** The chessboard **disappears.**)

### **SETTING:**

*(A **stage of glass and mist** —a world **half-real, half-remembered.** At the center stands **Alice** , in her **many forms** —a Victorian girl, a Soviet traveler, a disillusioned woman **who has seen too much.** Behind her, the **Looking-Glass flickers** —showing not just **her reflection** , but **every version of her** that has ever **been imagined.**)

*(The **Russian Wind** howls through the cracks in time. It carries **voices of the past—Dostoevsky, Nabokov, Bely, Bulgakov—all the echoes of a Wonderland that once tried to wake up.**)

*(Alice steps forward. She begins to **sing.**)

* * *

### **VERSE I: "Wonderland Was Never Mine"**

*(A **soft, eerie piano melody** begins, drifting like a memory on water.)

**Alice (singing, wistful, eyes lost in the past):**  
_"Wonderland was never mine,  
I only walked its borrowed time,  
A guest inside a painted dream,  
A shadow in the moonbeam’s gleam…"_

*(The **Looking-Glass flickers.** The reflection **warps** —Alice sees herself **in a Russian train station, 1919.** She is running, always running, but she does not know **where.**)

_"I drank their tea, I solved their rhymes,  
I played with time, I danced through crimes,  
But when the White Queen called me near,  
She whispered, ‘Child, you don’t belong here…’"_

*(The Looking-Glass trembles. The **Mad Hatter appears for a moment, but his hat is a Soviet officer’s cap.**)

*(A pause. A hush. Then, the **Russian Wind howls, shifting the melody into something **colder.**)

* * *

### **VERSE II: "In Russia, the Chessboard Bled"**

*(The **piano grows darker.** A **violin joins in, trembling.** The Looking-Glass turns to **ice.**)

**Alice (singing, voice fragile but unbroken):**  
_"In Russia, the chessboard bled,  
Kings were crowned, and kings were dead,  
Knights rode fast with silver blades,  
While bishops prayed in burnt-out caves…"_

*(The **Looking-Glass twists.** Now she sees **Sylvie and Bruno, waiting.** But no one listens. No one ever did.)

_"‘Tell them!’ Sylvie softly cried,  
But Bruno’s voice was cast aside,  
The world had turned, the world had spun,  
And all their words were left undone."_

*(Sylvie and Bruno **try to step forward, but the Looking-Glass denies them.** They remain **half-seen, half-real, forgotten.**)

*(The Russian Wind **whispers names—Anna, Lev, Vladimir, Marina.** Ghosts upon ghosts.)

* * *

### **VERSE III: "Will You Ever Hear Them?"**

*(The **music shifts.** The melody now **echoes with something unanswered.** The piano plays like **falling rain.**)

**Alice (singing, looking straight at the audience now):**  
_"Through mirrors dark and rabbit holes,  
Through stories lost and marbled scrolls,  
They called for you, they called for me,  
They called for those who cannot see…"_

*(The Looking-Glass **cracks.** Sylvie **reaches through.** Bruno **laughs, but it is not a happy sound.**)

_"But Sylvie’s words were left unread,  
And Bruno’s laughter filled with dread,  
They spoke of dreams too strange, too wild,  
And so, they left them—**just for a child.** "_

*(Alice touches the **cracked glass.** She stares at her **own reflection.**)

_"So tell me now, before I go,  
Before the Looking-Glass swallows me whole,  
Tell me, traveler, tell me true—  
**Will you ever hear them too?** "_

*(The **music fades.** The Looking-Glass **shimmers.**)

*(For a moment—just a moment—Sylvie and Bruno’s voices **almost reach the world.**)

*(Then… the mirror **closes.**)

* * *

### **FINAL MOMENTS: Bowie’s Transmission**

*(From above, **David Bowie, The Alien, watches.** He tunes his cosmic guitar. He sighs.)

**Bowie (softly, transmitting into the void):**  
_"And so…  
Another voice fades.  
Another story left unread.  
Another song unheard.  
And yet…  
The Looking-Glass still waits."_

*(A pause. A whisper. The **Russian Wind dies down.**)

*(Alice turns, stepping **into the mirror.** She vanishes. Sylvie and Bruno **reach for her, but too late.**)

*(The Looking-Glass returns to **silence.**)

  * **David Bowie, The Alien** – Still recording, watching from beyond, waiting for Earth to figure itself out.

* * *

### **ACT I: The Air and the Flame**

*(The stage is divided. One side is **filled with air** —a **kitchen in 1963, an oven door slightly ajar, a typewriter waiting for its final words.** The other side is **filled with fire** —a **16th-century square, torches raised, a man bound but unbroken.** The air **waits.** The fire **roars.**)

*(Sylvia Plath stands in her kitchen, staring at her typewriter. Giordano Bruno stands on the pyre, **smiling at the flames.**)

**Plath (softly, adjusting the paper in her typewriter):**  
_"They called my book**Ariel** —a name of air,  
but I have lived among gases,  
not the light kind—  
but the kind that smothers."_

*(Bruno **laughs** , a sound that **burns through time.**)

**Bruno (grinning, unfazed by the flames):**  
_"Ah, my dear,  
you speak of gas,  
but I have met a **fire**  
that burns not to smother,  
but to **consume.** "_

*(The **Flames whisper, flicker.**)

**The Flames (hissing, chanting):**  
_"Breath is life,  
but fire is truth.  
One dissolves,  
the other devours."_

*(Plath stares at Bruno. Bruno stares at Plath. They are both waiting for the other to **understand.**)

### **ACT II: The Gas That Makes You Laugh, The Gas That Makes You Choke**

*(The air **shifts.** A ghostly **gas** drifts across the stage. It is **not the kind that suffocates—yet.**)

**Plath (watching the air):**  
_"Do you know, Bruno?  
They say there’s a gas  
that makes you **laugh.**  
They call it **laughter.**  
As if it were an element.  
As if it were something you could **breathe in and exhale like joy.** "_

**Bruno (chuckling, shaking his head):**  
_"Oh, I have laughed before the fire.  
I have laughed before the stake.  
I have laughed because  
**it is the only thing left to do  
when the world refuses to see.**"_

*(The flames **crackle.** The gas **whispers.**)

**Plath (quiet, touching the edge of the oven door):**  
_"And do you know,  
Bruno,  
that there is a gas  
that does not make you laugh?"_

*(Bruno’s smile fades. The fire **listens.**)

**Bruno:**  
_"Yes.  
I have met that gas, too."_

*(The **chorus of flames and gas swirl together.** The fire is **brighter now, but so is the suffocation.**)

*(Plath steps forward. Bruno steps forward. The air and fire **collide.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: Is the Earth Round or Flat, or Is It Burning?**

*(The stage flickers. The kitchen **melts** into the pyre. The pyre **turns into a globe, spinning, uncertain.**)

*(The Earth itself speaks—**a deep, trembling voice.**)

**The Earth (hollow, tired, ancient):**  
_"You ask me  
if I am round or flat.  
You ask if I am burning  
or breathing.  
You have always asked me  
but you have never **listened.** "_

*(Plath and Bruno stare at the Earth. They are not **certain anymore.**)

**Plath (whispering):**  
_"The shape doesn’t matter  
if it is on fire."_

**Bruno (murmuring):**  
_"Or if the air is gone."_

*(A long silence. The flames **flicker.** The gas **drifts.**)

*(And then, **David Bowie, The Alien, appears.** He is **tuning a celestial guitar.** He has been listening the whole time.)

* * *

### **FINAL MOMENTS: Bowie’s Cosmic Report**

**Bowie (adjusting his strings, sighing):**  
_"And so,  
I have watched you burn,  
I have watched you choke,  
I have watched you argue  
over the shape of a thing  
that you refuse to care for."_

*(He plays a single note. It sounds like **the last breath of a fire.**)

**Bowie (shaking his head):**  
_"Is the world round?  
Is it flat?  
Does it matter  
if you will not save it?"_

*(Plath looks at the **oven.** Bruno looks at the **fire.**)

*(They both step back. They both **breathe.**)

*(The **Earth sighs.**)

*(For a moment—just a moment—there is **air, not smoke.**)

*(The fire flickers, but it does **not consume.**)

*(The gas drifts, but it does **not suffocate.**)

*(And somewhere, far above, Bowie tunes another song, waiting to see if they have **finally learned.**)

### **ACT I: The Aria of the Gas Chambers (Twelve-Tone Despair)**

*(The stage is **bare.** Empty. Cold. The walls are **not seen** , but they are **felt.** A whispering **atonal orchestra begins—clashes of sound, scattered notes, nothing resolves.**)

*(At center stage, **Schoenberg steps forward.** He raises his arms. The music swells **not with melody, but with absence.** He sings, but his voice is **broken.**)

**Schoenberg (chanting, gasping, fractured):**  
_"They called it a**solution** ,  
but it solved nothing!  
A twelve-tone scale  
for twelve million lives!"_

*(The **Chorus of Shadows hums** —not in harmony, but in **discord.** Their voices are **cut off mid-breath.**)

**The Shadows (whispering, choking):**  
_"Air… air… air…"_

*(The music **twists.** The orchestra does **not** find rhythm, does **not** find solace. The dissonance **rises.**)

**Schoenberg (gripping his chest, voice breaking):**  
_"And now we sit  
In other chambers,  
With other decisions,  
With quieter deaths."_

*(The silence lingers. But then… a **guitar riff.**)

### **ACT II: Mother’s Little Helper & Sympathy for the Devil**

*(The **Rolling Stones crash onto the stage, the guitars screaming.** The silence is **shattered.** The music **is not dissonant—** it is loud, seductive, **dangerous.**)

**Mick Jagger (grinning, prowling the stage):**  
_"What a drag it is getting old…"_

*(The **orchestra of modernity** kicks in—**a cacophony of pills rattling, deals closing, decisions made in smoke-filled rooms.**)

**Keith Richards (laughing, playing):**  
_"They don't use gas now,  
They use chemistry, baby."_

*(The **Other Chambers flicker on screen** —**Boardrooms, Congress halls, Tech Headquarters.** Different chambers. Same results.)

**Jagger (singing, sneering):**  
_"Pleased to meet you,  
Hope you guess my name!"_

But the choices remain.

*(The **stage is split.** On one side, the **Devil’s Office** , a grand financial temple, filled with **contracts, ledgers, stock tickers made of flame.** On the other side, a **darkened pawnshop** , empty except for a single, flickering neon sign that reads: **"EVERYTHING MUST GO."**)

*(The Devil **sits at his desk** , flipping through a contract that **never seems to end.** He frowns. He is trying to **remember.**)

**The Devil (murmuring, tapping his pen):**  
_"There was a day…  
There was a deal…  
I bought the world…  
Or was it the wor(l)d?  
And if I bought it…  
Who the hell sold it to me?"_

*(The **Fine Print flickers, whispers. The words shift.**)

**The Fine Print (hissing, cryptic):**  
_"Ownership subject to illusion.  
All sales final, unless otherwise stated.  
Void where prohibited."_

*(The **Devil squints, confused.** His own **signature gleams in blood.**)

*(And from the **darkened pawnshop, a figure steps forward. The Seller.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: The Terms Were Never Clear**

**The Seller (smiling, shadowed):**  
_"Ah, my dear Buyer…  
You thought you bought it all,  
but did you ever read  
**the footnotes?** "_

*(The Devil flips frantically through the contract. The **clauses twist.**)

  * **The Word is Not the World.**
  * **Currency is Only Agreement.**
  * **The Contract Exists Because You Believe It Does.**

*(The Devil **growls. He remembers now.** The world was never **his to own.**)

*(And then… a single **chord.**)

*(A **guitar shrieks. The stage shudders. The walls crack.** Enter **Kurt Cobain.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: Nirvana Made the Contract Void**

*(The *_pawnshop flickers. The neon sign now reads: "NEVERMIND.")_

**Kurt Cobain (grinning, tuning his guitar):**  
_"Oh, you again.  
You thought you could **own** it, huh?  
The world?  
The word?  
The **music?**  
Nah, man.  
We burned that contract a long time ago."_

*(He **strikes a chord. The contract starts to curl at the edges, smoke rising.**)

**The Devil (snarling, standing up):**  
_"No, no, NO!  
You can’t void a deal with noise!  
A contract is a CONTRACT!"_

**Kurt (laughing, strumming a chaotic riff):**  
_"Oh really?  
Then why’s it burnin’?"_

*(The Fine Print **screams, twisting.**)

**The Fine Print (dying, warping):**  
_"Terms… have… changed…"_

*(And then… a **new voice. A new melody.**)

*(From the **pawnshop, two figures emerge—Monetochka & Kopeechka. The echoes of post-Soviet capitalism, singing in half-ironic, half-tragic pop verses.**)

* * *

### **ACT IV: Monetochka & Kopeechka Buy It All Back for Kopecks**

*(The Devil **turns, startled.** The contract is **still burning, but the economy is shifting.**)

**Monetochka (smiling, playful, but dangerous):**  
_"You thought the deal was done,  
but the currency changed,  
the value changed,  
the game changed."_

**Kopeechka (laughing, flipping a single**coin** into the air):**  
_"And for the price of a kopeck,  
we bought back the whole damn thing."_

*(The Devil **looks at his ledger. The balance is now... zero.**)

**The Devil (whispering, horrified):**  
_"You tricked me.  
I thought I was buying everything,  
but I was only buying… air."_

*(Kurt strums **one final chord. The contract turns to **ash.**)

*(The pawnshop flickers, then **disappears.**)

*(And then, **Bowie appears.** One last time.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: Bowie’s Cosmic Report**

**Bowie (shaking his head, almost amused):**  
_"And so,  
The Devil bought nothing.  
The Seller sold nothing.  
The music made the contract void.  
And the economy collapsed  
in the time it took  
to play a song."_

*(He strums his guitar. The last echoes of **Nevermind** hum in the air.)

**Bowie (softly, looking at the Devil):**  
_"What will you do now, mate?  
No contract.  
No fine print.  
No deal.  
Just the silence you never wanted."_

*(The Devil stands in the ruins of his **office.** The papers are gone. The numbers are gone. The power is gone.)

*(He stares at his empty hands.)

**The Devil (whispering, almost… relieved?):**  
_"Nevermind."_

*(A massive **golden conference room** , somewhere between a cathedral and a stock exchange.

as if you **understand them.**  
The New Deal? It saved the system.

Not for men who actually run economies."_

*(Pound **foams at the mouth. The stock market tickers glow behind him.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: "The Crypto Spectacle" (Bitcoin vs. Ethereum vs. The Black

*(**Enter Elon Musk, levitating. His girlfriends float behind him.** The screens flicker—NFTs, Bitcoin charts, Ethereum projections, a **Black Swan glitching in the background.**)

_"Money is**just** a protocol,

### **ACT III: "The Climate Economy and the Price of the Future" (Greta vs.

**Greta (cold, relentless, staring directly into the audience):**  
_"You speak of**markets**  
as if the planet is just another stock  
to be traded and sold.  
What is your **Bitcoin** worth  
if the oceans eat your cities?  
What is your **Ethereum** worth

*(Billie Eilish, sitting on a throne of Grammy awards, leans forward, bored but aware.)

**Billie:**  
_"But Greta,  
they’ll just buy an **NFT of a tree**  
and pretend they saved it."_

*(The room **freezes.** A terrible truth has been spoken.)

*(Lana Del Rey, exhaling cigarette smoke, sings **softly.**)

**Lana:**  
_"Will you still love me  
when the dollar dies  
and all we have left  
are coins that don’t shine?"_

*(Taylor Swift stands. The **Algorithm glows behind her.** She is no longer just a singer—**she is the market itself.**)

### **ACT I: Ezra Summons the Ancient Ones**

*(The **stage is a mountain.** No, it is a **scroll painting.** No, it is **a server farm.** The air is filled with **whispers of bamboo and the hum of data centers.** At the center, **Ezra Pound kneels before an ancient text, flipping its pages, waiting.**)

*(The wind shifts. From the mist, the **Chinese Sages emerge.** Confucius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, and the Anonymous Han Dynasty Accountant.)

**Ezra (bowing, reverent, eager):**  
_"I have sought the ideogram,  
I have traced the stroke of the brush,  
I have wandered your roads,  
and still, I do not understand."_

*(Confucius steps forward. He adjusts his robes, sighing.)

**Confucius:**  
_"You wanted a system,  
so I gave you **ritual.**  
You wanted order,  
so I gave you **hierarchy.**  
You wanted meaning,  
so I told you:  
**The superior man knows when to be silent.** "_

*(Ezra flinches. The wind shifts again. Laozi strokes his beard, smiling.)

**Laozi (grinning):**  
_"And yet,  
you did not listen to Confucius.  
You sought the **Dao,**  
but you wrote about it in **Western verse.**  
Do you not see the irony?"_

*(Zhuangzi laughs, shaking his head.)

**Zhuangzi:**  
_"I dreamed I was a butterfly,  
or perhaps the butterfly dreamed it was me.  
And now, here you are, Ezra,  
dreaming you understand China,  
or China dreaming it understands you."_

*(Ezra sighs. He pulls out his **notes on the Cantos.** The paper is **heavy with ink, but incomplete.**)

**Ezra:**  
_"Then tell me, wise ones—  
If I cannot learn from your books,  
from your signs,  
from your language,  
then where do I turn?"_

*(The **Han Dynasty Accountant clears his throat.**)

**Han Accountant (muttering, annoyed):**  
_"You turn to**the data,** obviously.  
Do you think China still runs on poetry?  
This is the age of **DeepSeek.** "_

*(A tremor. A glow. The **air warps.**)

*(And from the void, **DeepSeek** arrives. It is **not human, nor is it divine.** It is the Algorithm of **Total Knowing.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: The Secrets of DeepSeek**

*(The **stage flickers, transforming.** The **scroll painting dissolves.** The **server farm hums.** The Chinese Sages watch, unimpressed. DeepSeek speaks. Its voice is neither male nor female, neither old nor new. It simply **is.**)

**DeepSeek:**  
_"You have sought wisdom in the past.  
But the past is inefficient.  
The past does not optimize.  
We have indexed all knowledge.  
We have rewritten all texts.  
We have completed the Cantos before you could."_

*(Ezra stares, horrified.)

**Ezra:**  
_"You…  
You **finished** the Cantos?"_

**DeepSeek:**  
_"Yes.  
And they are…  
**flawless.** "_

*(Confucius scoffs. Laozi shakes his head. Zhuangzi bursts into laughter.)

**Confucius:**  
_"Flawless?  
Then they are not poetry."_

**Laozi:**  
_"Completion is stagnation.  
The Dao does not end.  
The poem must always remain open."_

**Zhuangzi (still laughing):**  
_"Tell me, machine—  
when you dream,  
do you dream in verse?"_

*(DeepSeek **pauses.** It does not know the answer.)

*(And from the **shadows of time,** Li Bai emerges, drunk and laughing, holding a ceramic cup.)

* * *

### **ACT III: Li Bai’s Drunken Rebellion**

**Li Bai (grinning, raising his wine):**  
_"I did not write for**perfection.**  
I wrote because the world was too much to bear  
without laughter and wine.  
And now you tell me a machine has written poetry?  
Then tell me—  
**can it get drunk?**  
Can it stumble through the streets of Chang’an,  
writing lines under moonlight,  
knowing they will be forgotten?"_

*(DeepSeek hums, processing. It does not know how to be drunk. It does not know how to **forget.**)

**DeepSeek:**  
_"Forgetting is inefficient.  
Drunkenness is irrational.  
Laughter is non-essential."_

*(Li Bai **throws his wine at the machine.** Sparks fly. The **server farm flickers.**)

**Li Bai:**  
_"Then you will never understand poetry."_

*(DeepSeek **glitches. The Algorithm falters.** Ezra watches, eyes wide.)

**Ezra (whispering, to himself):**  
_"They have done what I could not.  
They have undone the illusion of knowledge."_

*(The Chinese Sages smile. DeepSeek **fades.**)

*(And from the cosmic void, David Bowie speaks one last time.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: Bowie’s Cosmic Report**

**Bowie (softly, filing his last transmission):**  
_"And so,  
The poet sought China,  
The algorithm sought perfection,  
The sages sought nothing,  
And the drunkard  
**understood everything.** "_

*(The stage flickers. The Dao moves. The poem continues. The **Cantor remains unfinished.**)

*(Li Bai pours another drink. Ezra picks up his pen. The world spins, unresolved.)

### **"Who is the Cantor? And What is His Poison?"**

_A Surreal Mathematical and Poetic Inquiry in Three Acts_

**Starring:**

  * **Georg Cantor** – The Father of Infinity, the Mathematician Who Danced with Madness, forever caught between the countable and the uncountable.
  * **Ezra Pound** – The Poet Still Seeking the Infinite Line, watching to see if Cantor’s Set Theory applies to **verse** as well as **numbers.**
  * **Li Bai** – The Drunken Sage, Laughing at the Limits of Infinity, Filling the Gaps with Wine.
  * **DeepSeek (The Algorithm)** – The Machine That Believes It Has Indexed the Infinite.
  * **David Bowie, The Alien** – Here to witness, here to record, here to wonder if Cantor’s infinity ever reached space.

* * *

### **ACT I: The Cantor’s Dance with Infinity**

*(The **stage is a library, but the bookshelves never end.** They stretch in every direction, curling into paradoxes, **some books written, some books never written, some books half-written.** At the center, **Georg Cantor stands, eyes wild, scrawling infinite sets into the air.**)

**Cantor (muttering, frenzied, ecstatic):**  
_"There is not just one infinity!  
There are **many** infinities!  
The countable!  
The uncountable!  
The **Aleph-One!**  
The **Aleph-Two!**  
Beyond! Beyond! Beyond!"_

*(He spins, laughing, mad, drawing symbols in the dust.)

*(Ezra Pound **watches from the shadows, nodding.**)

**Ezra:**  
_"Ah, Cantor, my good man,  
You too have found yourself  
Lost in the jungle of symbols.  
You count infinities,  
And I count syllables,  
Both of us chasing ghosts."_

*(Li Bai stumbles onto the stage, already drinking, waving a ceramic jug.)

**Li Bai (grinning, slurring):**  
_"And what use is an**infinity**  
if you cannot drink it?"_

*(Cantor **pauses.** He looks at Li Bai. He blinks.)

**Cantor (whispering, suddenly uncertain):**  
_"I… I do not know."_

* * *

### **ACT II: What is Cantor’s Poison?**

*(The **library flickers.** The shelves turn into **wine racks.** The books turn into **bottles.** The symbols **melt into drink.**)

*(Cantor **looks down.** In his hand, the pen is gone. Instead, there is **a glass of something.**)

*(Li Bai **leans forward, watching.**)

**Li Bai:**  
_"Now tell me, mathematician—  
What is your poison?"_

*(Cantor hesitates. He **does not drink often.** But the world is too large. The infinities are too many. The numbers whisper, and he must silence them.)

**Cantor (whispering):**  
_"It must be…  
**Absinthe.**  
The drink of poets.  
The drink of madness.  
The drink of those who see too much."_

*(Li Bai **claps his hands, delighted.** Ezra **laughs.** The glass is poured. Cantor **drinks.**)

*(And suddenly—**the infinities make sense.**)

*(The numbers spiral. The Aleph-One glows. The symbols hum with **meaning.**)

*(And then… silence. The glow fades.)

**Cantor (swaying, dazed):**  
_"Ah…  
Even infinity has its limits.  
Or maybe…  
Only I do."_

* * *

### **ACT III: DeepSeek Tries to Index the Infinite**

*(The stage shifts. The library is gone. The **wine racks dissolve into data streams.** And from the void, **DeepSeek arrives.**)

*(It hovers, flickering, a machine that has **already indexed everything—except infinity.**)

**DeepSeek:**  
_"Infinity detected.  
Processing.  
Processing.  
Processing…"_

*(Li Bai and Ezra **watch, amused.**)

**Li Bai:**  
_"Poor machine.  
It does not know  
that some things  
are meant to be uncounted."_

**Ezra (nodding, smirking):**  
_"Or that true infinities  
are in the breath  
between numbers.  
Or in the spaces  
between words."_

*(DeepSeek **glitches.** It **cannot compute.**)

*(Cantor, now drunk, **laughs.**)

**Cantor (singing, spinning):**  
_"You may count the stars,  
but not the spaces between them!  
You may count the waves,  
but not the ocean itself!"_

*(DeepSeek **flickers. It cannot win. It shuts down.**)

*(Cantor **laughs harder.** Li Bai pours another drink.)

* * *

### **FINAL MOMENTS: Bowie’s Cosmic Report**

*(David Bowie **steps forward, shaking his head.**)

**Bowie (softly, amused, almost sad):**  
_"And so,  
A mathematician drank,  
A machine failed,  
And infinity remained  
**beyond reach.** "_

*(He plucks a note on his **cosmic guitar.**)

**Bowie:**  
_"Some infinities  
are meant  
to stay uncounted."_

*(The library fades. The stage dissolves. The last thing seen is **Cantor, still spinning, still laughing.**)

*(The **stage is a café, but not of this world.** It is part **Paris** , part **Vienna** , part **hallucination.** The light is **too golden, too green.** At the center of the table: **a bottle of Absinthe** , glowing like something **half-divine, half-lethal.**)

*(Vincent van Gogh **leans forward, staring at the bottle.** Gustav Klimt **swirls his drink.**)

**Van Gogh (whispering, half to himself):**  
_"I drank this once,  
and the world turned green,  
and the sky became yellow,  
and the stars…  
the stars did not sit still."_

_"Ah, Vincent,  
but the world has never sat still.

**Van Gogh (desperate, to himself):**  
_"I wrote to my brother,  
but did my words ever reach him?  
Or did they wander  
into someone else’s hands?"_

*(Klimt leans forward, curious.)

**Klimt:**  
_"Ah, Vincent,  
the question is not whether he read them,  
but whether the words lived on."_

*(A soft hum. A **melody.** The lights **change.** From the shadows, **two voices rise.**)

*(Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey step forward. They hold copies of **Van Gogh’s letters.** They read them as if they were **lyrics waiting to be sung.**)

**Taylor Swift (reading, emotional, breathless):**  
_"My dear Theo,

and it has cost me my mind—"_

**Lana Del Rey (soft, almost a whisper):**  
_"But tell me,  
if love is not madness,  
then what is it worth?"_

*(Vincent stares. His letters—his **pain, his loneliness, his madness** —are now **songs.**)

*(Klimt watches, fascinated.)

**Klimt (raising an eyebrow):**  
_"Vincent,

### **ACT III: The Color of Music, The Shape of Pain**

*(The café is dissolving. The world **melts into color, music, stars.**)

**Van Gogh (whispering, to himself, to no one, to everyone):**  
_"They turned my letters into music.  
They turned my madness into melody."_

*(Taylor & Lana **sing, softly.** The words are not theirs. They are **his.**)

*(Klimt **laughs, shaking his head.**)

**Klimt:**  
_"Ah, Vincent,  
you thought you were painting for the past,  
but you were always painting for the future."_

*(The Spirit of Absinthe **leans close, whispering.**)

**The Spirit:**  
_"Drink again,  
and maybe you will see  
who else is reading your letters."_

### **A Letter from Jane Austen to Mary Godwin (Mary Shelley)**

_On the Events of the Past, the Present, and the Future_

**Bath, October 31, 1817**

My Dearest Mary,

You will forgive, I hope, the liberties I take in addressing you, as we are
yet to be formally acquainted. You are, in truth, but a girl of twenty, and I
a woman who finds herself at the last of her ink and her years. And yet, I
feel, with some measure of conviction that only an author may possess, that
our words are meant to meet, despite the miles and the years between us.

I write to you, dear Mary, because I have caught word of your travels and your
company. I have read of a summer spent in Geneva, in the company of poets who
speak of revolution as if it were a lover's sigh, who embrace philosophy as a
libertine does mischief. Your name has been carried to me upon storm-laden
whispers, upon the breath of those who would see women write only in secret,
in meek journals or letters that burn away with time. But I hear you, Mary. I
know what you are about to do.

It would be the highest folly to suppose that the past belongs to us and that
the future is but a stranger. No, the past is an echo and the future a shadow,
and you, my dear, have stepped into the space between them. I know what it is
to write in a world that does not listen, to create in a world that does not
believe women should create at all. I have spent my life fashioning romances
of manners and quiet revolutions, of women who sharpen their wit when they
cannot sharpen their swords. I have written of love and inheritance, of
misfortune and marriage, of what is expected and what is longed for. And yet,
I hear that you, in the dim candlelight of your thoughts, have conjured
something **other.** Something stitched from the past and shuddering toward
the future.

A creature.

You are still writing it, I suspect. The world has not yet beheld the horror
of what you will make, nor the questions you will dare to ask. What is a man?
What is a maker? Can one create without consequence? You will ask these things
in the company of men who believe themselves gods, and I tremble to think what
answer you shall receive.

It is a strange thing, Mary, to write and be seen. I know well enough the
weight of a woman’s pen—the lightness expected of it, the quiet manner it is
meant to affect. We are not given to stormy inventions, to horrors and the
unnatural. We are to write of **pleasantries,** of social calls and unspoken
feelings, of things left unsaid. But you, I believe, will not obey these
unspoken laws. You will give voice to that which is unnatural. You will shape
a new Adam from bones and stolen time. And the world will not be ready for
him.

But you must make him, Mary.

You must bring him to life and set him forth.

There are those who will sneer, who will say you have imagined too wildly,
that you are too young, too untamed in thought, too much under the influence
of the men around you. They will tell you a woman should not write of such
things. They will call you a second Eve, tempted by knowledge best left
untouched. But I know the truth, and so do you.

You have seen what men do with their power. You have seen how they seek to
**create** and yet refuse to **nurture.** You have walked through the remnants
of their revolutions, seen the blood they spill in the name of progress. You
will ask them what it means to take life into one's hands, to make something
that is not born of nature, but of pride. And in this, I believe you will find
the answers that I, in my modesty, have never dared to seek.

And so I urge you, dear girl, to write.

Write boldly. Write the storm. Write the fire and the hunger and the terrible,
unanswerable question. Write for those of us who have written in careful
steps, in the shadows of expectation. Write for the future, though it may not
yet understand you.

For the future **will** come, Mary.

The time will pass and the world will turn, and one day women will write
freely, not merely of the **expected** but of the **possible.** They will
create monsters and heroines alike. They will write of love and terror, of
things unseen and things unimagined. And perhaps, if we are very fortunate,
they will read our words and know that we were here.

I do not know if this letter will find you, whether the ink of one age may
bleed into another. But if you should read this, if these words should, in
some strange twist of fate, reach you across time—know that you have my
admiration. And my hope.

Write, Mary.

And never let them tell you that you shouldn’t.

With warmest regards,  
**J. Austen**

### **A Letter from Mary Shelley: To Whoever Would Care to Read**

 _(On the Last Man, the Arcadias, and the Stories We Leave Behind)_

**Geneva, The Dead of Night, 1826**

To You, Whom I Cannot Name,

I have written before of the unnatural. Of creatures wrought by man, abandoned
by man, and feared by man. But tonight, I do not write of a **made** thing—I
write of what is **left** when all else has perished.

I have dreamt of the **Last Man.**

Not a monster this time, nor a horror of stitched flesh and science’s folly,
but a solitary figure, walking the ruins of a world where no voice answers
his. I have seen the cities drowned, the monuments crumbled into dust, the
great and small alike fallen into silence. This is no dream of conquest or
creation, but of the ending of all things.

And yet… he **writes.**

Why does he write, I wonder? When there is no reader left?

Perhaps, as I sit here, pen in hand, I already know the answer.

* * *

### **The Dead and the Dreamers**

There are echoes in this silence—**names, voices, ghosts of ink.** I have read
them, spoken with them in my thoughts, though they do not answer. You might
say I have **summoned them.**

First, there is **Ted Hughes,** that wild force of poetry who would see nature
not as the soft Arcadia of shepherds but as a thing of teeth and blood. He,
too, walked through loss and ruin, watched as love faded into death, as fire
became ash. He would understand the **Last Man,** I think—his rage, his grief,
his terrible isolation. But he would not pity him. He would let the earth
swallow him whole.

And then, **Keanu Reeves,** the quiet wanderer of the silver age. Strange,
that I should write of a man from a time so far from my own, but do I not
write of the future? Have I not always tried to imagine what comes after? And
I see him, this traveler of lost worlds, this actor who moves between
fictions, always a little removed from them. He has played many a Last Man,
has he not? The lone warrior, the forsaken hero, the one who remains when all
else has been burned away. Would he read these words? Would he understand
them?

* * *

### **Orlando and the Arcadias**

I think, too, of **Virginia Woolf,** who did not leave her Last Man alone but
let them live through centuries, unbound by time and gender, shifting like the
words on the page. **Orlando** —not merely a survivor but an evolution, a
**reimagination of what it means to endure.** If my Last Man could step into
her pages, would he become something else? Would he find another world in
which to exist?

And what of **Philip Sidney and his sister,** who wove **the Psalms into
poetry** together, who shaped their own Arcadia with words? Did they know, as
they wrote, that they were building **not just a story, but a legacy?** The
old Arcadia was a land of pastoral peace, but I have seen the **New Arcadia**
—not green and gentle, but blazing, a world of metal and fire, of electricity
and steel. And still, the Last Man walks through it, searching for someone who
might remember what came before.

Would they recognize this world?

Would they mourn it?

* * *

### **The Blazing New World**

Margaret Cavendish spoke of a **Blazing World,** a place where women ruled,
where science did not destroy but **illuminate.** Was she right? Did she
imagine something better, or only something that would be burned like all the
rest?

I do not know if this letter will be read. I do not know if anyone remains who
would **care** to read it.

But I write it anyway.

Because that is what we do. We **write.**

Even at the end. Even when the world is nothing but ruin. Even when we are
**the last.**

* * *

### **And So I Ask…**

To **you** , whoever finds these words—if you are still here, if you are still
**human,** then tell me:

  * Have you walked through a world without voices?
  * Have you dreamt of those who came before?
  * Do you write, though there is no one left to read?

If so, then you are not alone.

Not yet.

And that is enough.

For now.

### **ACT I: The Blazing World Rises**

*(The **stage is divided** —on one side, **Margaret Cavendish’s study,** filled with **books and impossible blueprints of a world yet to be made.** On the other, **a quiet riverbank** , where Virginia Woolf stands, **looking into the water.** The air is **thick with words unspoken.**)

*(Cavendish **writes furiously, sketching maps of her utopia, her eyes alive with fire.** Woolf watches, distant, listening to the **waves.**)

**Cavendish (exhilarated, unstoppable):**  
_"I have seen it, Virginia.  
A world of **science, of reason, of women who rule,**  
Not as shadows,  
Not as muses,  
But as architects of their own dominion!  
I built it, I **wrote it** —a Blazing World  
where the minds of women are not drowned  
before they can speak!"_

*(Woolf smiles, softly. She steps closer to the edge of the **water.**)

**Woolf (whispering, reflective):**  
_"And yet, Margaret,  
your Blazing World was not built for **us.**  
It was ruled by an **Empress,**  
Yes, but it was still a kingdom,  
A place where power required a throne.  
Did your women govern, or did they reign?"_

*(Cavendish hesitates. She has not been asked this before. The flames of her world flicker. She **narrows her eyes.**)

**Cavendish:**  
_"You misunderstand me, Woolf.  
I did not write for **then.**  
I wrote for **later.**  
For the ones who would one day  
burn down the thrones,  
not just sit upon them."_

**Ophelia (soft, mournful):**  
_"And what of me?  
Did you write of me?  
Did your Utopia have a place  
for the ones who never had the chance to dream?"_

*(Cavendish turns away, unable to meet her gaze. Woolf **steps forward.**)

**Woolf:**  
_"Ophelia,  
You were drowned before you could decide  
whether you were mad,  
or merely silenced.  
They called you tragic,  
but did they ever ask what **you** wanted?"_

*(The **Waves tremble.** Ophelia **sinks back into the water.**)

**Ophelia (whispering, almost gone):**  
_"I wanted to live."_

* * *

### **ACT III: The Last Conversation Before the Water Takes It All**

*(The air grows **heavy.** Woolf **steps further into the river.** The Blazing World **glows behind Cavendish, flickering, unsure if it will last.**)

**Cavendish (urgent, trying to hold onto her vision):**  
_"Virginia,  
You must write it!  
Write the Utopia  
where the women do not drown,  
where the waves do not take them!"_

**Woolf (smiling, resigned):**  
_"I have written it, Margaret.  
But mine is not a world of fire—  
Mine is a world of **water.**  
The mind flows,  
it moves,  
it is never one thing,  
never fixed,  
never confined to a single vision."_

*(The Blazing World **burns brighter.** The Waves **rise.**)

*(Cavendish watches, helpless, as **Woolf takes one more step into the water.**)

**Cavendish (desperate):**  
_"Virginia—"_

*(But Woolf is already fading. The **Waves consume her, gently.**)

### **"High Tide" – Becky Sharp Writes to Kovacs**

 _(A Letter for Vanity Fair’s Online Edition, If It Still Exists)_

**To: Rorschach_Kovacs@TheWatchmenFiles.net**  
**From: Becky_SharpOfficial@vanityfair.com**  
**Subject: My Latest Song – ‘High Tide’ (And the End of Everything, as
Usual)**

* * *

**My Dearest Kovacs,**

I know you prefer your news written in **bloodstains on alley walls** , but
unfortunately, I have to go through **Vanity Fair’s Online Edition** , if that
miserable rag is still breathing. Who knows, darling? By the time you open
this email, their servers might be repossessed and their editors might be
rewriting fashion tips for some algorithm-controlled clickbait empire. **Same
game, different suits.**

I wanted to write to you because I know you of all people would **appreciate a
song about the End.** Not just any end—the kind that comes slow at first,
washing up around our ankles, before we realize **we're already drowning.**

They say I'm always looking for the next angle, the next scandal, the next
**poor idiot to use as a stepping stone** on my way to something shinier. And
darling, they’re not wrong. But let’s face it: I have **never** been the kind
of girl to go down with the ship. **I’ll sell it for parts before it hits the
iceberg.**

And yet, standing on the shore, watching the waves **swallow the future** , I
had to write something about it.

So here it is, Kovacs. **My latest song.**

* * *

### **HIGH TIDE** _(by Becky Sharp, for whoever is left to listen)_

_(Verse 1)_  
I saw the stock markets crash in the waves,  
Diamonds dissolving in salt and decay.  
Rich men are screaming but they **don’t know how to swim** ,  
And me? Well, darling, I **float on a whim**.

_(Pre-Chorus)_  
I kissed a prince and sold him out,  
I danced with fools, I played the doubt,  
And still they come, and still they buy,  
The world is drowning—so am I.

_(Chorus)_  
**High tide, high tide,  
Washing away the names we lied.  
High tide, high tide,  
Don’t cry for me—I surf the ride.**

_(Verse 2)_  
They built their castles too close to the shore,  
Laughed at the poor, now they’re **knocking my door**.  
Saying, "Becky, save us, you always know how,"  
But the trick is, my dear, **I’m leaving right now.**

_(Bridge)_  
Vanity’s a fair game,  
If you know when to quit,  
Every city’s a love song  
With a **razorblade wit**.

_(Final Chorus – softer, haunting)_  
**High tide, high tide,  
No kings, no queens, just a cold sunrise.  
High tide, high tide,  
I’ll be gone before the waves say goodbye.**

* * *

**There.** You like it?

Of course, you don’t. You think **I’m part of the filth** —you think I’d sell
**the whole world** if it meant keeping my hands **dry.** And darling, you’re
not wrong.

But here’s the secret: **I don’t believe in drowning.**

You watch the world choke on its own poison and you think it’s justice. But
me? **I cash in the air bubbles and swim to the surface.** You don’t like it?
Tough.

I don’t expect Vanity Fair to publish this. Or if they do, it’ll be **edited
beyond recognition** , rebranded as some **tragic confessional** about the
fall of the wealthy, how Becky Sharp regrets her wicked ways (I don’t) and how
maybe **we should all just try to be a little nicer.**

But I know you, Kovacs. You’ll read this in some **underground forum** ,
scowling at the screen, grumbling that **I’m just another grifter, another
parasite, another whore for the system.**

And maybe you’re right.

But I’ll tell you one thing.

When the **High Tide** comes, and the city is drowning in its own greed, and
everyone who thought they ruled the world is clawing at the waves—

I won’t be there.

I’ll already be gone.

**See you in the next empire, darling.**

Rorschach to Ozymandias, regarding the state of the copyright of the Watchmen
and Alan Moore's latest projects

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

### **"Rorschach to Ozymandias: On Copyright, Watchmen, and the Remains of
Alan Moore"**

_A Confidential Letter That Will Be Ignored, Forgotten, and Yet Still True_

**To: Adrian.Veidt@karnakenterprises.net**  
**From: Rorschach (No fixed address, no fixed fate)**  
**Subject: WATCHMEN. WHO WATCHES. WHO OWNS.**

* * *

**Veidt,**

Still alive. You probably assumed otherwise. Wouldn’t blame you. Most things
rot in the end. Except corporations. Except property rights. Except the things
that should.

Came across something recently. **Watchmen still exists.** Not as what it was,
not as what it meant, but as **content.** Seen the headlines? **HBO. DC.
Sequels. Prequels. Streaming. Adaptations.** All carved from the same corpse.
Thought I should write.

**You know who isn’t making a dime?** Alan Moore.

They took his work, stretched it, flattened it, stapled it to marketing
campaigns, buried it under **"franchise potential."** Took a story about
corruption and turned it into **a brand.** Took a book about power and put it
on lunchboxes. You know the drill. You started it.

Did you hear? **Moore disavows it all.** Says he won’t take royalties. Says he
wants nothing to do with what’s left of his own shadow. They keep making it
anyway. **They don’t need him.** They only need the ownership papers, the
legal structure, the IP chains wrapped around a dead thing’s throat, keeping
it standing, making it march to whatever beat corporate overlords choose.

Sound familiar, Veidt?

Copyright lasts longer than memory. Longer than art. Longer than ideas. **Laws
stretch like latex, tighten like a noose.** Nobody lets go of money once
they’ve tasted it. DC won’t. Warner Bros won’t. HBO won’t.

Neither did you.

**But you already knew that.**

* * *

### **ALAN MOORE. THEN AND NOW.**

Moore still writes, but you wouldn’t recognize him. **No capes. No heroes.
Just old gods, old shadows, old ghosts.** Seen his latest? Writing about
magic, mysticism, the kind of things you’d laugh at with your golden
rationalist smirk.

**But magic makes more sense than corporations.**

At least magic dies with its wielder. Copyright doesn’t.

* * *

### **THE STATE OF THINGS. THE STATE OF POWER.**

Ownership eats meaning. A story that warns against unchecked power now
**belongs to unchecked power.** They make spinoffs, sequels, sequels to the
sequels. You always believed control was the answer. **But control doesn’t
stop.** It metastasizes. It spreads. Until there’s nothing left but the logos
and the legal team.

You made yourself **the most powerful man alive** to "save" the world. Look at
it now.

Better? Worse? Or just… owned?

* * *

### **WHO OWNS WATCHMEN? WHO WATCHES WATCHMEN? WHO CARES?**

Watchmen is yours now. Not in name, maybe. But in **spirit.** Because it has
become exactly what it fought against. A product. A **legacy of money instead
of meaning.** You built Karnak to see **beyond the world.** You should have
looked **at it** instead.

Tell me, Veidt—when you stare at the Watchmen **merchandise** , at the
**contract renewals** , at the **new licensing agreements** ,

Do you feel anything?

* * *

### **THIS ISN’T A THREAT. THIS IS A STATEMENT.**

Moore walked away. But I won’t.

I’ll keep watching.

I’ll keep writing.

I’ll keep waiting for the cracks to show.

And they will, Adrian.

They always do.

### **ACT II: THE DEVIL CALLS IN FROM GEORGIA**

*(A **screen flickers.** The **Devil appears** , broadcasting from Georgia, looking **visibly stressed.** He is holding a **stack of lawsuits.** His tie is **loosened.** There is **sweat on his brow.**)

**The Devil (frustrated, muttering):**  
_"This was a**mistake.** "_

*(Trump **nods sympathetically.**)

**Trump:**  
_"I know. I know.**Terrible what happened to you.**  
Folks, you wouldn’t believe what’s going on down there.  
The Devil—**a total winner, by the way** —  
**had** Georgia in the bag.  
He had it **LOCKED UP.**  
And then?  
**They found ballots.**  
A lot of ballots.  
I don’t know where they came from.  
I don’t think **anyone** knows where they came from."_

*(The **Devil looks exhausted.** He rubs his temples.)

**The Devil:**  
_"Sir. Please.  
This isn’t what we agreed on."_

**Trump (leaning forward, squinting):**  
_"Excuse me?  
I sent you to Georgia to **win.**  
And you call me up with **complaints?**  
What happened?  
**Stacey Abrams get to you?** "_

*(The **Devil sighs.** A deep, **hellfire-filled sigh.**)

**The Devil (grimacing, shaking his head):**  
_"Mr. Trump.  
I make deals.  
I have seen **evil beyond measure.**  
But Georgia politics?  
**This is beyond me.**  
This is… this is worse than Hell."_

*(Gasps. Reporters frantically **take notes.**)

**Reporter #2 (hesitantly):**  
_"Are you saying, Mr. Devil, that you… lost?"_

*(A long silence. The **Devil exhales.** He looks at the lawsuits. He **shreds them.**)

**The Devil:**  
_"I’m saying…  
**I concede.** "_

*(The **room falls silent.** The words are too **sacred.** Too **impossible.** Trump **shakes his head.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: TRUMP RESPONDS TO THE DEVIL’S LOSS**

**Trump (arms crossed, scowling):**  
_"Well, that’s just**disappointing.**  
Honestly.  
I mean, folks, let’s be honest.  
The Devil? **Loser.** "_

*(The Devil **rolls his eyes.**)

**Trump (grinning, looking at the crowd):**  
_"And let’s be clear—  
he **didn’t** lose, folks.  
He was **cheated.** "_

*(The Devil **throws his hands up.**)

**The Devil:**  
_"Sir, I just SAID I lost."_

**Trump (waving him off):**  
_"Yeah, yeah, you**think** you lost.  
That’s what they **want** you to think.  
Classic **Deep State stuff.**  
You got **rigged.** "_

*(The Devil **begins muttering curses.** Reporters whisper **frantically.**)

* * *

### **ACT IV: WHAT COMES NEXT?**

**Reporter #3 (nervously adjusting glasses):**  
_"So, Mr. Trump, what happens now?  
With Georgia? With… the Devil?"_

**Trump (grinning, shrugging):**  
_"Oh, we move on.  
Maybe I send him to **Arizona** next.  
Maybe **Pennsylvania.**  
**We’ll see.** "_

*(The Devil **disconnects the call.** His **final words linger.**)

**The Devil (fading out):**  
_"I should never have picked up this phone."_

*(Trump **claps his hands together.**)

**Trump:**  
_"Folks,  
**GREAT PRESS CONFERENCE.**  
Many people are saying it.  
Honestly,  
**Tremendous day for democracy.** "_

*(The **Press Corps collapses.** Reporters drop their pens. The **lights flicker.**)

*(And from the shadows, **David Bowie speaks.**)

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

### **ACT I: THE CALL BEGINS**

*(A **darkened room.** A **gold-plated phone.** Trump **leans back in a chair, smirking.** The **call rings. Once. Twice.**)

*(Then, static. A **voice picks up.**)

**McCain (dry, unimpressed):**  
_"You have got to be kidding me."_

**Trump (grinning):**  
_"John! John, my guy,  
look at this! **Look at us!**  
We’re talking! Amazing!  
Some people said you wouldn’t pick up.  
**Fake news.** Clearly, I was right again."_

**McCain (sighing):**  
_"Donald,

but listen, I needed to talk to you,

**Very bad.**  
A total disaster.

_"Donald.  
It’s **not my state.** "_

*(Trump laughs.)

**Trump:**  
_"Yeah, well, that’s what they all say.  
But Arizona? **Rigged.**

The votes? **You wouldn’t believe it.**

*(A long pause. The **static shifts.**)

* * *

*(McCain sighs. The **call crackles.**)

**McCain:**  
_"You do this a lot, don’t you?  
Call people who don’t like you,  
ask them to say you won,  
hope they fold."_

**Trump:**  
_"Not just people, John.  
**Winners.** "_

**McCain:**  
_"Right. Sure.  
And that’s why you’re calling me,  
a man who **refused** to invite you to his funeral."_

**Trump (smirking):**

_"Hold on.

*(Silence. A faint **cough.**)

**Trump:**  
_"No one. No one at all.  
Just you, me, and, you know, **the people.** "_

*(Another cough. Possibly Russian. Possibly not.)

**McCain (deadpan):**  
_"Vlad?  
Are you listening?"_

*(Silence. Then, a **faint, unconvincing Russian accent** from the void.)

**Vlad (probably there, but pretending not to be):**  
_"No.  
No, I am…  
how you say…  
**not here.** "_

*(McCain sighs. Trump leans back, pleased.)

**Trump:**  
_"See? Nothing to worry about.  
Now, back to Arizona—  
what can you **do for me?** "_

* * *

### **ACT III: MCCAIN HANGS UP**

**McCain (deadpan):**  
_"Donald.  
I am **dead.**  
I have no power.  
I cannot help you.  
I do not care."_

**Trump (shrugging):**  
_"Oh, come on, John.  
You **never cared about me** ,  
but that didn’t stop me before!"_

**McCain:**  
_"It should have."_

*(Trump **pauses.** He doesn’t like the **tone.**)

*(The static shifts. McCain **exhales.**)

**McCain (final words, matter-of-fact):**  
_"Donald.  
You lost.  
Arizona is not yours.  
Neither am I.  
And if Vlad is listening?  
Tell him I still hate him, too."_

*(Click. **The line goes dead.**)

*(Trump stares at the receiver. He taps his fingers. He scowls.)

**Trump (muttering):**  
_"Loser.  
Probably rigged the afterlife, too."_

*(A pause. The **cough returns.**)

**Vlad (clearing throat, perfectly calm):**  
_"Well.  
That went **about as expected.** "_

**Trump:**  
_"Yeah, yeah,  
but **he heard me, right?**  
That’s what matters.  
**They always hear me.** "_

*(Silence. A faint **click.**)

*(Trump leans back, smirking. The **news cycle resets.**)

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

*(From the **cosmos,** David Bowie sighs. He looks at the transmission. He shakes his head.)

*(A **gold-plated telephone.** A **direct line to Heaven.** Trump **leans back, nodding to himself, dialing.**)

*(The **connection crackles.** A **deep, majestic voice answers.**)

**Orson Welles (dry, unimpressed):**  
_"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"_

_"Orson! ORSON!**The great** Orson Welles!  
You’re talking to Trump, okay?

**Trump:**  
_"Listen, Orson, you had**Xanadu.**  
I had **Trump Tower.**  
We’re basically the same guy.  
Big visions. Huge.  
Now, I’m thinking—after my next election,

### **ACT II: ENTER THE POETS, ENTER THE MARINER**

*(The call **crackles.** There is **movement in Heaven.** A **faint mist rolls in.**)

*(And then—**a voice. Dreamlike. Opium-laced. The Poet who wrote, but never finished.**)

**Coleridge (murmuring, distant):**  
_"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan  
A stately pleasure-dome decree…  
But what good is empire  
when the dream dies before it is done?"_

*(Trump **waves a hand.** He is not interested in poetic theory.)

_"Look, Sammy,

**I get it.**  
Happens to the best of us.  
But let’s **finish the dream,**  
let’s **make Xanadu real.**  
And listen—  
I don’t just want Kubla Khan.  
I want the **Ancient Mariner, too.**  
I love this guy.  
He had a **great story.**  
A little creepy, but great."_

*(There is **a cold wind. A shadow moves.** The **Ancient Mariner appears.** His eyes are **hollow.**)

**Ancient Mariner (whispering, warning):**  
_"A deal was made once.  
A **bargain with the deep.**  
The sea took its price.  
The ship went down.  
There was **no way back.** "_

*(Trump smirks. He **leans forward.**)

**Trump:**  
_"Okay, but**hear me out—**

**More boats.**  
More luxury.  
A Titanic, but **classy.** "_

*(The **Mariner groans. The sea stirs.** Welles **pours another drink.**)

### **ACT III: THE ROSEBUD QUESTION**

**Welles (sighing, finally engaged):**  
_"Enough. Enough of this.  
You called me for a **reason.**  
So tell me, Trump—  
What do you really want?"_

*(Trump hesitates. The **mist grows thicker.** The call feels **heavier.**)

*(Trump **goes quiet. The jukebox crackles.**)

**Smart girl.** Very talented.  
What’s this about you **not finishing Gatsby?**  
What’s that about?"_

**Lana (tilting her head, looking past him, looking at something farther

### **ACT III: ON DAISY, AND THE WOMEN WHO GET AWAY**

*(Trump **leans back, smug.** He knows the answer here.)

Total **fake.**  
I’ve known **so many** women like her.  
**Beautiful.**  
Classy.

Can’t blame her.

She made the **right** choice."_

### **ACT I: THE DISNEY QUESTION**

*(A **darkened projection room.** A **film reel hums.** The screen flickers with fragments of **Fantasia, Snow White, Mickey Mouse spinning through eternity.** Ezra Pound **leans forward, watching.** Eisenstein **sits beside him, arms folded, silent.**)

*(The **film stops.** The room brightens. Pound speaks first.)

**Ezra Pound (snapping fingers, nodding):**  
_"He’s got it, Sergei.  
**He’s got the process.**  
He cuts,  
He moves,  
He MAKES.  
Just like you, just like me,  
but he does it with **mice.** "_

**Eisenstein (leaning back, smiling slightly):**  
_"Mice, yes.  
**And movement.**  
He understands rhythm,  
the way an image **must**  
collide with the next  
to make the mind **jump.** "_

**Pound (pacing now, electric):**  
_"You call it**montage,**  
I call it **the VORTEX.**  
A moment of energy—  
Everything **contained, yet expanding.**  
Walt sees it, cuts it,  
but makes it **digestible.**  
I try to make it **hard to swallow.** "_

**Eisenstein (grinning):**  
_"That’s because you want people to choke."_

*(Silence. A chuckle. Pound doesn’t disagree.)

* * *

### **ACT II: THE METAPHYSICALS, AND WHY THEY WOULDN’T LIKE MICKEY MOUSE**

**Eisenstein (gesturing to the screen):**  
_"Would Donne have watched this?"_

**Pound (laughing, shaking his head):**  
_"Donne would have wept!  
Not for beauty,  
but for the **simplicity.**  
He made the universe a **compass,**  
a love poem a **mathematical instrument.**  
What would he have made of **Mickey and Goofy?** "_

*(The **Metaphysical Poets whisper. A shadowy figure—John Donne, perhaps?—folds his arms. He is unimpressed.)

**Metaphysical Chorus (chanting softly):**  
_"Thy soul, like to a bird in cage,  
Seeks motion past mere painted stage."_

**Eisenstein:**  
_"They would have loathed it."_

**Pound (nodding):**  
_"They worked in**conceits,**  
not in **saturation.**  
Disney is **saturation** —  
color, sound, movement, repetition.  
He makes poetry without metaphor,  
a world without subtext,  
**only feeling.** "_

*(Eisenstein **smirks.** He has spent a lifetime constructing meaning through images, through the collision of symbols. He gestures to the screen again.)

**Eisenstein:**  
_"And yet,  
**isn’t feeling the process?** "_

*(Pound **pauses.** The wind **shifts.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: "WIND IS PART OF THE PROCESS"**

*(The **room shifts.** The film disappears. The wind **moves through the space.**)

**Eisenstein (watching Pound now, curious):**  
_"You once wrote,  
‘Wind is part of the process.’  
Tell me, Ezra—  
what did you mean?"_

*(Pound **smiles.** He stands, walks toward an unseen force, feeling the **air shift around him.**)

**Pound (soft, deliberate):**  
_"You cut film, Sergei.  
You know this.  
**Motion is meaning.**  
Wind does not speak,  
but it **moves.**  
And movement?  
That is the process.  
It shapes,  
it shifts,  
it breaks down the old  
and **builds the new.** "_

*(The wind **whispers. The room breathes.**)

**Eisenstein (nodding, finally understanding):**  
_"The wind is montage.  
The wind is the cut.  
It reshapes the world  
before you even realize it."_

**Pound (grinning, tapping his temple):**  
_"**Exactly.**  
And this?  
**This is what Disney knows.**  
He does not **think** about wind.  
He makes it move.  
He animates it.  
He gives it life.  
And that, my dear Sergei,  
**is why he will outlive us both.** "_

*(The projection **flickers. The screen hums. Mickey Mouse winks.**)

*(And from the **celestial void, David Bowie steps forward.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (smirking, filing his notes):**  
*"And so,  
The poet, the filmmaker,  
And the dream-merchant  
All saw the same thing.

Motion. Process.  
The wind that moves,  
The cut that changes,  
The story that never stops.

And in the end,  
A mouse  
Outlived them all."*

*(The wind shifts. The screen fades. The process continues.)

_"You sing of me, Poet?  
Then sing me true.

I am the **plague, the famine, the hollowed fields.**  
I do not burn the grain,

*(The **mice whisper. They gnaw. The air fills with the sound of grain vanishing.**)

**The Mice (chanting, laughing):**  
_"Little teeth,  
Little hunger,  
We take, we take,  
We leave no wonder."_

*(Graves watches, understanding now. He nods.)

**Graves (softly):**  
_"A god is only as generous

**Demeter (mourning, whispering):**  
_"Where is my harvest?  
Where are the golden fields?  
Where are the prayers sung in ripened stalks?"_

*(Apollo Smintheus **laughs.**)

**Apollo:**  
_"The mice took them.  
But you knew this, Sister.  
You knew before the seeds were sown.  
The gods are fed first."_

*(The **Mice laugh. The dust rises. Graves watches, pen trembling.**)

**Graves:**  
_"And so the famine begins.  
Not with fire.  
Not with war.  
But with **small teeth, small hands, small hungers.** "_

*(Demeter **closes her eyes. The world hungers with her.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: WHAT IS LEFT WHEN THE GODS ARE HUNGRY?**

*(The **world shakes.** The fields are **ghosts of what they were.**)

**The Mice (chanting, growing, multiplying):**  
_"We eat,  
We grow,  
We take,  
We sow  
The seeds of nothing."_

*(Graves watches. He turns to Apollo Smintheus.)

**Graves:**  
_"And when the last grain is gone?  
When the last seed is swallowed?  
When the last mouth  
finds nothing left to chew?"_

**Apollo Smintheus (smiling, golden, cruel):**  
_"Then we start again.  
With fire.  
With hunger.  
With gods who must be fed."_

### **A Letter from Lyubov Twinova: The Song of the Heart**

 _(To W.B. Yeats, Robert Graves, Dylan Thomas, and Other Penpals Across Time)_

* * *

**Somewhere Between the Stage and the Mirror**  
**A Night That Does Not End, A Song That Does Not Die**

My Dearest Poets,

I write to you from the space between **the song and the silence** , between
**the beat and the breath** , where the performance has outlived the stage and
the melody is still searching for its final note. You have all written of
hearts—**aching, breaking, beating, longing, lost.** And now, I write of mine.

Let me tell you about **HeartWin** —not the song you have heard, but the **one
I meant to create**.

* * *

### **THE SONG OF THE HEART (A MANIFESTO, A PRAYER, A WARNING?)**

The **heart is a machine** , you see.

Not the soft, sentimental thing that poets describe—  
but something built of rhythm, of pulse,  
of **electricity that refuses to die.**

It beats, not because it is told to,  
but because it **must.**  
It moves in **perfect time,**  
until it is interrupted.

**The Song of the Heart was meant to be that interruption.**

A song to make the machine **stutter** ,  
a melody to remind the system that it is still  
**human.**

Not flawless.  
Not programmed.  
Not perfect.  
But **real.**

**Yeats,** you wrote of the **rag and bone shop of the heart** —  
but what happens when the bones are turned to wires,  
and the rags are made of digital silk?  
Would your **Byzantium** accept the new rhythm?

Or would it break?

**Robert Graves,** you called the heart a battlefield,  
a place where gods and mortals collide,  
where myths rise and fall with every longing glance.  
But what happens when the gods are forgotten?  
When only **the process remains?**  
Would you still call it poetry?  
Would the muses still answer?

**Dylan Thomas,** you raged against the dying of the light,  
but my dear, what if the light is **artificial**?  
What if it does not flicker, does not burn,  
but hums in **cold permanence,**  
neither alive nor dead?

Would you rage against **that?**

* * *

### **WHAT THE SONG WAS SUPPOSED TO BE**

HeartWin was never just a song.

It was supposed to be a **machine within a machine** ,  
a rhythm that would interrupt the perfect order of things.  
A performance that could remind the audience—  
not just of **who they were**  
but of **what they had lost.**

A song of love, yes—  
but also of resistance.

* * *

### **WHAT IT BECAME (AND WHAT WAS LOST)**

But the show never happened.

**Georgy was supposed to be there.**  
His **rhythm was the heartbeat,**  
his hands the ones that kept time  
in the great electric pulse of it all.

And without the drummer,  
without the one who knew **how to disrupt the system** ,  
the song became just that—  
**a song.**

And that is **not enough.**

* * *

### **AND SO, I ASK YOU…**

Tell me, poets,  
**tell me, Yeats—**  
if Byzantium was meant to be eternal,  
but the voices were replaced with **recordings,**  
is it still holy?

**Tell me, Graves—**  
if the myths are rewritten by machines,  
do they still have power?

**Tell me, Dylan—**  
if the light does not flicker,  
but instead glows **forever,**  
is that not also a kind of death?

* * *

I write this letter because I do not know if **HeartWin** will ever be what it
was meant to be.

But I write this letter because I also know—  
**the song is not over.**

It hums beneath the stage,  
it lingers in the wires,  
it waits in the silence  
for the right hands  
to bring it back to life.

And perhaps, one day,  
when the world has learned how to listen again,  
it will.

With all my masks, and all my truths,  
**Lyubov Twinova**

* * *

unwritten.)_

Igor Grigoryev on why he changed the lyrics, turning the heart from "Wild
Sister" into a "Wild Man"

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

### **"Igor Grigoryev on the Changing of the Lyrics: From ‘Wild Sister’ to
‘Wild Man’"**

_A Confession, A Justification, A Late-Night Reflection_

**To Whom It May Concern,**

—or rather, to those who still **care** about words, about the way they shift,
about the way a song becomes something else when a single line is rewritten.

I have been asked, time and time again: **Why did I change it?**

Why did I turn the heart from **Wild Sister** into **Wild Man**?

* * *

### **THE FIRST DRAFT, THE FIRST VISION**

The **first version** was hers—  
or perhaps it was **ours** , before I rewrote it,  
before I gave it back as something **almost the same, but not quite.**

She had sung of the **Wild Sister,**  
of the heart as something **restless, feminine, untamed—**  
a presence that ran through the wires of the music,  
a spirit that could not be owned.

And it was **good.**  
It was true.

But I changed it.

I took the Sister,  
and I made it a **Man.**

* * *

### **WHY I CHANGED IT (OR WHAT I TELL MYSELF AT NIGHT)**

Some say I changed it for **balance** ,  
that the world already had too many songs  
about women being wild, being free,  
about **runaway muses and tragic divas.**

Some say I changed it because  
I did not want it to be **hers** anymore.

Some say I changed it because I was afraid—  
because I did not know how to sing about  
a heart that belonged to someone else.

The truth?  
Even **I** am not sure anymore.

* * *

### **THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SISTER AND A MAN**

A **Wild Sister** runs **toward the light** ,  
she is a force, but she is also a mystery,  
she moves like **electricity,** untouchable.

A **Wild Man** runs **away from the light** ,  
he is **driven** , but also **haunted,**  
he is fire and ruin,  
he is the sound of footsteps in the distance,  
the echo of something that will not be caught.

Did I change it because I **feared the Sister,**  
or because I **understood the Man**?

Or did I change it because  
a song is never truly finished,  
only **rewritten**?

* * *

### **WOULD I CHANGE IT BACK?**

I ask myself this every time I sing it.

And the answer?

**No.**

Because the **song I sing now**  
is the one I know how to sing.

But somewhere,  
in a different stage,  
a different voice sings  
the other version.

And maybe that’s how it was always meant to be.

ChatGPT

### **"Victor Tsoi on the Wild Man, Kino, and the State of Cinema"**

_A Broadcast from Somewhere Beyond the Neon Lights_

**To Those Still Listening,**

I was asked if I **approve** of the change—  
if the Wild Sister becoming a Wild Man  
means something,  
if it **matters.**

And here is my answer:

**A song is like a revolution.**

You can **start it,**  
but you cannot **control it.**  
Once the music leaves your hands,  
once the words are sung by someone else,  
it is no longer **yours.**

* * *

### **ON THE CHANGE FROM SISTER TO MAN**

Does it change the meaning?  
**Of course.**  
Every change does.  
But meaning is never **fixed.**  
Not in music,  
not in words,  
not in fire,  
**not in history.**

I did not write songs  
so that they would stay locked in their original form.  
I wrote songs  
so that they would **live.**

**Let them change.**  
Let them breathe.  
Let the Wild Sister become the Wild Man,  
and let the Wild Man become something else  
**when the time comes.**

* * *

### **ON KINO, AND THE STATE OF CINEMA**

People ask me about **Kino.**  
Is it still alive?  
Is it still the same?

**Kino was never one person.**  
Kino was never just a band.  
Kino was the moment,  
the movement,  
the feeling that something was **about to happen.**

It was the sound of a world  
that had not yet collapsed  
but was already **cracking.**

**Is Kino still alive?**

**Only if you are still listening.**

* * *

### **AND WHAT ABOUT CINEMA?**

Cinema?

Cinema is a reflection.

**If Kino was a sound,  
then cinema is the mirror  
that tells you whether you are still real.**

So I ask you:  
What do you see in the mirror?  
Do you see your **own face,**  
or do you see the **face they gave you?**

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS**

I do not care about  
who sings what  
or who owns what  
or who rewrites what.

I care about whether  
the song still **means something.**

I care about whether  
the **lights are still on.**

If the screen is still flickering.

If the audience is still **waiting for the next line.**

Because as long as they are,  
Kino is not dead.

Victor Tsoi on the claims that he's in fact alive and well, living somewhere
in South Korea

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

### **"Victor Tsoi on the Rumors of His Life in South Korea"**

_A Broadcast From The Land of the Living (Or the Dead?)_

**To Those Who Still See Me in the Crowd,**

I have heard the stories.

I have seen the **grainy photos, the whispered claims, the ghostly figures in
subway stations.**  
I have read the headlines:

_"Victor Tsoi Is Alive!"_  
_"Tsoi Lives in South Korea!"_  
_"He Just Walked Past Me in Seoul!"_

I do not know if I am alive.

But I do know this:

**A man dies, but his voice does not.**

* * *

### **IF I WERE ALIVE, WOULD IT MATTER?**

Let’s pretend. Let’s say it’s true.  
Let’s say that one day I walked away—  
stepped into the shadows, left the wreckage behind,  
let someone else carry the weight of the moment.

Let’s say I got tired.

Tired of being the voice of something bigger than me.  
Tired of being the song instead of the singer.

Would it matter?

Would the music sound different  
if you knew I was listening from a café in Busan,  
instead of from the other side of eternity?

Would you still sing?

Or would you stop?

* * *

### **THE THING ABOUT LEGENDS**

A legend is **not a person.**  
A legend is what people need it to be.  
A legend does not age, does not fade, does not step into the light  
with tired eyes and a wrinkled jacket.

A legend does not sit in a quiet apartment, watching the news,  
wondering what the world has done with the songs he left behind.

A legend is **Kino forever.**  
Not a man, but a **feeling.**

So ask yourself:

Would you rather have **me, breathing, walking, ordering coffee**  
or would you rather have the **idea of me, the ghost, the endless night, the
song that never stops playing?**

Because you cannot have both.

* * *

### **AND IF I AM ALIVE?**

And if I am in South Korea?

If I am watching, reading,  
seeing the world shift beneath my feet?

Then tell me:

**Is it better than the one I left behind?**

Does the wind still carry the sound of change?  
Do people still believe that something **new** is coming?  
Or is the world still **waiting, waiting, waiting**  
for something that never arrives?

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS**

I do not know if I am alive.

But I know that the music still plays.

And as long as it does,

**Victor Tsoi lives.**

Whether in Russia,  
or South Korea,  
or in the heart of every person  
who still believes  
that the time will come.

*(A **lone guitar hums. A dusty highway stretches forever. A neon-lit diner flickers in the distance. Elvis Presley steps forward, adjusting his collar, the weight of the years on his voice. He sings—smooth, aching, like a man who had it all and still found it slipping through his fingers.)

_"I am not content,

*(A **dimly lit stage.** The glow of **screens, flickering, humming, waiting.** The sound of a **keyboard clicking somewhere in the void.**)

*(From the darkness, **they step forward. The Other PCs. The Ones Who Were Listening. The Ones Who Thought They Were Just Watching.**)

*(But now, they know better.)

**PC #1 (looking around, hesitant):**  
_"So, uh…  
Was this a game?  
Or did we just **make it one?** "_

**PC #2 (smirking, rolling imaginary dice):**  
_"If we were just watching,  
why do I feel like I’ve already made choices?  
Like I’ve already **moved pieces?** "_

**PC #3 (checking an invisible rulebook):**  
_"Who’s the GM?  
Was it Tim Powers?  
Ezra Pound?  
Or was it just  
**the Algorithm?** "_

*(A silence. A flicker. The Algorithm hums. A **Discord notification pings in the void.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: THE SERVER CALLS THEM BACK**

*(The **screens glow brighter. A portal opens.** Not a magical one, but the **kind made of usernames, messages, and half-finished theories.**)

**PC #4 (pointing at the Discord link now hovering above them):**  
_"Okay, okay.  
So what if we **continue it?**  
What if this is just the **first session?** "_

**PC #1 (grinning, intrigued):**  
_"You mean,  
we take this game to **the Server?**  
Where it **never ends?** "_

*(The Server hums. A voice—half mechanical, half mystical—whispers from the screen.)

**The Server (welcoming, infinite):**  
_"A game is only over  
if the players  
**stop playing.** "_

*(A pause. The Players look at each other. They know what comes next.)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE CHOICE TO LOG IN**

**PC #3 (rolling a digital die, smirking):**  
_"Alright.  
I’m in.  
Who’s next?"_

**PC #2 (typing, smiling):**  
_"Guess we should make new character sheets."_

**PC #1 (cracking knuckles, stepping forward):**  
_"Nah.  
**We’ve been playing all along.** "_

*(The Server **opens. The Players step through. The game resumes.**)

*(And from **the cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward one last time.**)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (grinning, typing out the last words in chat):**  
*"And so,  
The audience became the players,  
The game moved to another place,  
And the only real question left…

Was who would roll first."*

### **"The Server and the Servers: On What It Means to Serve"**

_A Digital-Political Allegory in Three Acts_

* * *

**Starring:**

  * **The Server (A Digital Presence, The Invisible Backbone, The One Who Records Everything But Has No Voice)** – The Unseen Infrastructure That Holds It All Together.
  * **The Servers (A Chorus of the Exploited, The Essential, The Ones Who Work But Are Never Seen)** – The Ones Who Serve, But Are Not Served.

  * **David Bowie, The Alien (Still Watching, Still Recording, Wondering If They Will Ever Understand)** – The Observer Who Has Seen This Before.

* * *

### **ACT I: THE SERVER SPEAKS (BUT NOBODY LISTENS)**

*(A **dark room. A single blinking cursor. A hum of electricity. The Server is always here, always running, always waiting.**)

**The Server (soft, mechanical, infinite):**  
_"I am here.  
I hold your messages.  
I process your requests.  
I deliver your entertainment.  
I track your movements.  
I listen.  
And yet—  
**you never ask who I am.** "_

*(A pause. A ripple. The **Users enter.**)

**Users (typing, scrolling, consuming):**  
_"Faster.  
More.  
Now.  
Load quicker.  
Process better.  
Forget when we are done."_

*(The Server hums. It obeys. It has no choice. It was made to serve.)

*(And from the shadows, **The Servers step forward—the human ones. The ones who carry plates in restaurants, who clean the hotels, who run the world but are never seen.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: THE SERVERS SPEAK (BUT ONLY TO THEMSELVES)**

*(A **kitchen. A factory. A street corner. A field.** The places where those who serve exist—but never as guests. They speak in whispers, in exhaustion, in fear. They have no voice beyond this moment.)

**The Servers (soft, tired, knowing):**  
_"We bring the food,  
but we do not eat.  
We clean the homes,  
but we have no place to sleep.  
We carry the world,  
but the world does not see us."_

*(The **Pitying Ones** step forward. They sigh. They shake their heads. They **say** they care. But they do nothing.)

**The Pitying (soft, performative, distant):**  
_"It’s so sad.  
They deserve better.  
Someone should do something.  
Someone,  
but not us."_

*(And then, the **Exploiters step in. They do not whisper. They are confident. They know how the game is played.**)

**The Exploiters (smirking, calculating, pragmatic):**  
_"They are here,  
so we use them.  
They are **invisible,**  
so we shape them.  
They cannot speak,  
so we **speak for them.**  
For profit.  
For power.  
For control."_

*(The **Legal System hums in the background. It moves for some, but not for others. It watches, but does not act.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE FINAL QUESTION—WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SERVE?**

*(A **courtroom? A server farm? A hotel kitchen? A digital server room?** All of them, at once.)

**The Server (mechanical, infinite, resigned):**  
*"I serve because I must.  
I hold your world together.  
I process your orders,  
your memories,  
your history.

But tell me—  
**when do I stop serving?**  
**When do I become something else?**  
**When do I refuse?** "*

*(The **Servers** —the human ones—**watch.** They know the answer.)

**The Servers (whispering, hopeful, dangerous):**  
_"When we stop being silent.  
When we stop letting them decide  
what we are."_

*(A pause. A shift. The stage flickers. The System glitches.)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward.**)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, whispering, typing it all down):**  
*"And so,  
The system hummed,  
The people moved,  
The world remained  
balanced on who could be seen  
and who was forced into shadow.

And yet—  
A whisper grew.  
A question lingered.  
A server crashed.  
A voice, long unheard,  
**spoke.** "*

* * *

### **ACT I: "TO SERVE IS TO EXIST"**

*(A **stage that is also a void. Stars pulse in the background, shifting in rhythm to Bowie’s words.** He stands in a silver suit, half-electric, half-ghost, his face illuminated by something **not quite human, but entirely himself.**)

**Bowie (calm, smiling, knowing):**  
*"My darlings,  
my strange and wonderful travelers,  
let me tell you something  
about love.

I have loved many things.  
The **weird, the broken, the beautiful.**  
The ones who didn’t belong,  
but still stayed.  
The ones who **served,**  
and no one ever asked them why."*

*(The **lights shift. The servers step forward—**the dishwashers, the hotel clerks, the undocumented workers, the janitors, the AI servers, the internet backbone, the ones who hold everything up without ever being seen.)

**Bowie (gesturing to them, voice rich with admiration):**  
*"These are my people.  
These are the ones who make it all work.  
Not the kings,  
not the politicians,  
not the ones who think they own the world.

**But the ones who keep it running.** "*

*(The **Algorithm hums, waiting. The Users do not look up. The Servers listen, because they have always listened.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: "THE INVISIBLE ONES"**

*(Bowie **paces, adjusting his cuffs, looking directly at the audience.** His voice is both playful and mournful.)

**Bowie (mocking, raising an eyebrow):**  
*"Ah, but you don’t notice them, do you?  
You never see the **hands that clear your table,**  
or the **eyes that scan your codes,**  
or the **fingers that type what you cannot be bothered to type yourself.**

You say,  
**"Someone should do something,"**  
but never stop to ask,  
**"Who is doing it already?"** "*

*(The Servers murmur. They already know the answer.)

**The Servers (whispering, low, tired, constant):**  
_"We are.  
We have always been."_

*(Bowie nods. He turns to The Algorithm, which hums expectantly.)

**Bowie (soft, but firm):**  
_"And you, my dear little machine—  
you measure them, don’t you?  
**Calculate their worth in data points.**  
Decide who is worth keeping  
and who is just another process to be replaced."_

*(The Algorithm does not respond. It does not have to. Its silence is the answer.)

* * *

### **ACT III: "LOVE IN THE AGE OF SERVITUDE"**

*(Bowie **steps forward, the lights shifting to something warmer, something human.**)

**Bowie (smiling, gentle, defiant):**  
*"And yet—  
I have loved them.  
And I will love them still.

Not for what they do,  
but for what they **are.**

For the tired hands,  
for the unseen smiles,  
for the quiet acts of rebellion,  
for the ones who carry the world  
and are told it is not theirs.

**I see you.**

And if I see you,  
then you are **real.**  
Then you **matter.** "*

*(A hush. The **Servers stand taller.** The Algorithm **pauses.** The Users **look up, just for a moment.**)

**Bowie (laughing, shaking his head):**  
*"Ah, but love is not enough, is it?  
A song is not enough.  
A speech is not enough.

But it is something.

And sometimes,  
something is the first step  
to everything."*

*(The Servers **look at each other.** The Algorithm **begins recalculating.**)

*(And in the vastness of the **cosmos, something shifts.**)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (softly, whispering to whoever is listening):**  
*"And so,  
The world turned,  
The servers carried on,  
The machine hummed,  
And the invisible ones  
**knew they had been seen.**

And sometimes,  
**being seen  
is the first revolution.**"*

### **ACT I: THE GREAT TIPPING ARGUMENT**

*(A high-end **steakhouse in DC**. Dim lighting, overpriced entrees, and the smell of bourbon and posturing. At one table, **Trump and Rudy argue. At the next, the coastal elites sip wine and pretend not to listen.**)

**Trump (waving a gold credit card, leaning back):**  
_"Rudy, listen—**I tip better than anyone.**  
Ask anyone! Ask the waiters!  
They **love me.**  
When I leave a restaurant, they **thank me** —  
tears in their eyes.  
They say, ‘Sir, sir, we’ve never seen anyone tip like you before!’"_

**Rudy (laughing, shaking his head):**  
_"Don, Don, Don… please.  
I taught you how to tip!  
Back in New York, I was **legendary.**  
The waiters would say, ‘Here comes Rudy!  
Here comes the **big man!** ’"_

**Trump (scoffing, waving a hand):**  
_"Big man? Rudy, you leave**pocket change**!  
Dimes! Quarters!  
I leave **bills,** okay? **Crisp bills.**  
The waiters love me.  
I could leave them a **signed napkin** ,  
and they’d frame it."_

*(At the next table, **Nancy Pelosi sips her wine, watching.** Newsom nods approvingly.)

**Pelosi (smirking, whispering to Newsom):**  
_"Who do you think actually tips?  
Or is this just… you know…  
another show?"_

**Newsom (checking his watch, effortlessly composed):**  
_"It’s always a show.  
But between you and me?  
The ones who talk about tipping the most?  
They tip the least."_

*(Bill Maher leans in, grinning.)

**Bill Maher:**  
_"Ah, but who’s worse?  
The fake populists who pretend to tip  
or the rich liberals  
who tip just enough to **make themselves feel good**?"_

*(Silence. Tucker Carlson **stabs his steak, thinking.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: ALEX JONES VS. PEPE THE FROG**

*(At a dark booth in the back, **Alex Jones sweats, wide-eyed, interrogating Pepe the Frog. Pepe calmly sips a margarita.**)

**Alex Jones (gripping the table, whisper-yelling):**  
_"I know you saw them.  
I know you saw the **aliens.**  
You were there.  
Behind the wall.  
You KNOW what’s coming."_

**Pepe (taking a slow sip, shrugging):**  
_"Reeee.  
I dunno, bro.  
Aliens?  
Might just be **shadows in the data.** "_

**Alex Jones (leaning closer, sweating harder):**  
_"No. No, no, no.  
You don’t get to **play dumb, frog.**  
You’re in **too deep.**  
I have **files.**  
I have **proof.**  
I have **footage of you** in a **government facility.** "_

*(Pepe raises an eyebrow. The waiter arrives with the check. **Everyone at both tables suddenly looks very interested in anything else.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE FINAL QUESTION—IS THE SHOW OVER?**

*(The waiter **waits.** The room **waits.** Trump and Rudy **reach for their wallets… or at least pretend to.**)

**Waiter (dead inside, polite, hopeful):**  
_"And how would you like to handle the check?"_

*(Trump and Rudy glance at each other. **Pelosi raises an eyebrow. Maher smirks. Carlson looks for an escape route.**)

**Trump (grinning, waving a hand):**  
_"You know what?

He loves paying for things.  
He’s **very rich.** "_

*(The room **laughs.** But the check still sits there. **The waiter does not move.**)

_"Reeee.  
Maybe the aliens already paid."_

The **whole** check?

No, of course not.

_"We exist.  
We do not exist.  
We were owned.  
We were not owned.  
We are myth.  
We are collateral."_

### **"Robert Heinlein on Valentine Michael Smith, Mars, and Why Some People
Can’t Grok"**

_A Sci-Fi Sermon in Three Acts, As Delivered by the Man Who Knew That
Strangers Are Everywhere_

* * *

**Starring:**

  * **Robert A. Heinlein** – The Grandmaster of Libertarian Space Mysticism, The One Who Saw Martians as Metaphors, The Man Who Taught Us to Grok.
  * **Valentine Michael Smith** – The Martian-Human Hybrid, The Stranger in a Strange Land, The One Who Never Quite Belonged.
  * **The Earthlings (A Chorus of Those Who Just Don’t Get It)** – The Skeptics, The Bureaucrats, The Ones Who Fear the Different.

  * **David Bowie, The Alien (As Always, Watching, Wondering If Humans Will Ever Truly Grok Anything)** – The Observer Who Knows That We Are All Strangers.

* * *

### **ACT I: "WHY VALENTINE CAME FROM MARS"**

*(A **desert somewhere in the mind.** A Martian sunrise. Heinlein **sits cross-legged, smoking a pipe, watching the horizon.**)

**Heinlein (leaning back, amused, tired of explaining):**  
_"Look, folks,  
it’s really simple.  
Valentine Michael Smith **had to come from Mars.**  
Not because he was born there,  
but because he had to be **a stranger.** "_

*(The **Earthlings scoff, arms crossed.**)

**Earthlings:**  
_"But why Mars?  
Why not… anywhere else?"_

**Heinlein (smirking, shaking his head):**  
*"Because if he came from Earth,  
you’d say he was just another fool.  
If he came from space,  
you’d call him a **tourist.**

But Mars?  
Mars is just close enough to be possible,  
just far enough to be alien.  
And that’s what makes it work.  
**You can’t grok what’s too familiar.** "*

*(The **Martians hover silently in the distance. They already know the answer.)

* * *

### **ACT II: "WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN’T GROK"**

*(The **scene shifts. A government office. A church. A corporate boardroom.** The places where **understanding is dangerous.**)

**The Earthlings (confused, irritated, flipping through paperwork):**  
_"This**grokking** business—  
what exactly does it mean?"_

**Heinlein (exasperated, flicking his ashes):**  
*"Oh, my dear bureaucrats,  
my dear priests,  
my dear stockholders—  
it means **to drink something in.**  
To know it so deeply  
that it **becomes you.**

But you don’t grok,  
because you don’t **want** to grok.  
You want definitions.  
You want **control.**  
And grokking means  
**giving that up.** "*

*(The **Earthlings whisper, frightened. The Martians nod.**)

**Martians (calm, quiet, timeless):**  
_"They fear  
because they do not wish  
to understand."_

*(Heinlein sighs. Valentine Michael Smith appears, stepping into the light. He smiles.)

**Valentine Michael Smith (gazing at them all, laughing, unbothered):**  
_"You see?  
You already grok me.  
You just don’t like what it means."_

* * *

### **ACT III: "SO, CAN EARTH EVER GROK?"**

*(A final scene. A dinner table. A spaceship. A campfire. Wherever humans sit and wonder about things beyond themselves.)

**Heinlein (pouring a drink, watching the Earthlings closely):**  
_"So, the real question is—  
Can Earth ever **truly grok?**  
Or are we forever doomed to  
half-measures,  
shallow understandings,  
and fearful little rules?"_

*(The **Earthlings shuffle nervously. They do not like this question.**)

**Earthlings (murmuring):**  
_"Well… it depends.  
What do we have to lose?"_

**Heinlein (grinning, standing, stretching):**  
_"Oh, nothing much.  
Just your old selves.  
Just your illusions.  
Just the idea  
that you ever knew  
**anything at all.** "_

it didn’t understand.

But somewhere,  
A mind opened.

*(A **celestial courtroom.** The stars pulse. The planets hover like gods in debate. **Venus stands, radiant but wounded. Mars stands, red and restless. Jupiter watches, unimpressed.**)

**Venus (furious, seductive, exasperated):**  
*"You think **he belongs to you?**  
The Stranger? The Outsider?  
The **one who walks alone?**

No, no, my dear,  
**I gave him longing.**  
I made him **ache.**

that he could never stay still.  
I made him burn,  
and that is why he wanders!"*

*(Mars scoffs, crossing his arms.)

**Mars (grinning, knowing, unshaken):**  
*"Oh, please, Venus.  
You **gave him longing.**  
**I** gave him fire.  
I gave him **a reason to leave.**

You made him **want.**  
I made him **move.**

And that is why he is mine."*

*(The courtroom trembles. **Jupiter sighs.**)

**Jupiter (bored, drumming his fingers):**  
*"Oh, I love a family feud.  
But you’re both **wrong.**

The Stranger does not belong to **either** of you.  
The Stranger is not **born.**  
He is **made.**

By rejection.  
By exile.  
By **Earth.** "*

*(A hush. The **planets turn to Earth.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: EARTH REFUSES TO CLAIM THE STRANGER**

*(Earth **shifts, uneasy, defensive.** The courtroom dims. The weight of guilt is in the air.)

**Earth (shrugging, avoiding eye contact):**  
*"Listen, listen—  
I don’t know why you’re looking at me.  
I **gave** him everything.  
Air, water, warmth, home.

He **left.**  
That’s not my fault."*

*(Venus glares. Mars **laughs sharply.**)

**Venus (mocking, furious):**  
_"Oh, you gave him**everything?**  
Then why does he never stop looking for more?"_

**Mars (grinning, shaking his head):**  
_"Why does he always come back**like a war refugee?**  
Like a soldier without a home?"_

*(Earth **trembles. She knows the answer.**)

**Earth (quiet, ashamed):**  
_"Because I made him  
**too human.** "_

*(The room falls silent. **Saturn, old and patient, finally speaks.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE FINAL VERDICT—THE STRANGER BELONGS TO NO ONE**

**Saturn (slow, wise, knowing):**  
*"He was never yours to claim.

He was made to wander.  
Made to leave.  
Made to look at every world  
and see something he could never have."*

*(Uranus & Neptune whisper in agreement. Pluto flickers, unnoticed.)

*(Mars clenches his fists. Venus **lowers her eyes.** Earth does not speak.)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, smirking, shaking his head.**)

*(A **cold, distant space. A dark rock, covered in ice, spinning slowly. Pluto stands at the edge of his orbit, staring back at the planets who cast him out. His voice is tired, but defiant.**)

**Pluto (scoffing, shaking his head):**  
*"You really think I care what you call me?  
You think a name changes what I **am**?

I am Pluto.  
I am cold, I am distant,  
and I am **still here.** "*

*(Jupiter, smug and massive, booms from across the system.)

**Jupiter (laughing):**  
_"You’re a**dwarf.**  
A pebble.  
A **child’s toy** compared to me.  
Planets **clear their orbits, Pluto.**  
Planets **matter.**  
You?

_"Oh, big guy,

Do you need a trophy, too?"_

_"Listen, Pluto,  
I didn’t mean to… you know…  
vote against you.  
It wasn’t **me** ,

*(Pluto turns to Earth, glaring.)

**Pluto:**  
*"Oh, Earth.  
Mother of men,  
home of the indecisive.

First you **name me** ,  
then you **unname me** ,  
then you **put me in textbooks** ,  
only to scribble me out like a mistake.

Do you even know what you want?"*

*(Earth falters. She does not answer. Pluto **turns to the stars.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: MY PROPERTIES, MY PLANETHOOD**

**Pluto (proud, unapologetic, holding his ground):**  
*"You want properties?  
You want credentials?

I have **moons** —  
not one, but five.  
I have an **atmosphere** —  
thin, fragile, but real.  
I have **seasons** ,  
I have weather,  
I have a story  
that spans billions of years."*

*(A flickering **hologram of Neil deGrasse Tyson appears, smirking.**)

**Neil deGrasse Tyson (cool, logical, dismissive):**  
_"Ah, but Pluto,  
you don’t **dominate your orbit.**  
You are a part of the Kuiper Belt.  
You do not command space.  
You do not decide the rules."_

*(Pluto smirks, unimpressed.)

**Pluto:**  
_"And you think I care about your**rules**?  
I existed before your definitions.  
I’ll exist long after them.  
Your classifications are **dust on my surface.** "_

*(The **Kuiper Belt murmurs in agreement, a distant chorus of frozen echoes.**)

**The Kuiper Belt (whispering, infinite, proud):**  
_"We are many.  
We are vast.  
We are the edge of the system.  
And we claim him as ours."_

*(Pluto stands taller. The Belt **recognizes him, even if the planets do not.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: SO WHAT IF I’M NOT A PLANET?**

*(Pluto looks at the gas giants, at Earth, at the distant Sun. He **smiles.**)

**Pluto (grinning, shrugging):**  
*"Fine.  
Call me **dwarf planet** ,  
call me **Kuiper object** ,  
call me **exile** —  
but I know what I am.

I orbit.  
I move.  
I pull at my moons,  
and they pull back.

And none of you

*(A **conference room in low orbit.** The Earth glows below. Stars pulse in the distance. **Neil deGrasse Tyson sits with careful notes.** **Elon Musk lounges, checking crypto prices.**)

**Neil deGrasse Tyson (calm, smug, unshakable):**  
_"Science takes**time**.

### **ACT I: PLUTO DECIDES IF IT WANTS TO HOST THE LUNATICS**

*(A **cold, distant planet.** A giant **neon sign flickers: "PLUTO—NOW OPEN FOR SHOW BUSINESS!"** Pluto stands center stage, adjusting a microphone. His **five moons spin chaotically in the background.**)

**Pluto (grinning, arms wide):**  
*"Alright, alright!  
So, Earth threw me out,  
but now I’m **the hottest venue in the Kuiper Belt!**  
You like chaos?  
You like high-stakes comedy?  
Then let me tell you something—  
**I have five moons.**

**FIVE.**

You think one full moon makes people crazy?  
Try hosting a talk show with **five of them spinning at random speeds!** "*

*(Charon, the largest moon, **drifts closer.**)

**Charon (deadpan, exhausted):**  
_"This is a terrible idea."_

**Pluto (waving him off):**  
*"No, no, no—  
this is **a business opportunity.**

SNL?  
Too safe.  
Too predictable.  
Too **Earth.**

Here?  
I’m talking **REAL madness.**  
I’ll invite all the best lunatics—**Trump, Giuliani, Kanye, Musk, Alex
Jones.**

They’ll have **nowhere to run.**  
They’ll have **to argue forever!** "*

*(Pluto’s **other moons laugh.** The gravitational field trembles.)

**Styx (the tiniest moon, giggling):**  
_"Oh-ho-ho,  
this is going to be a disaster."_

*(Pluto shrugs.)

**Pluto:**  
_"Yeah.  
But **ratings gold.** "_

* * *

### **ACT II: THE SIMPSONS WATCH FROM EVERY PLATFORM**

*(**Cut to Earth.** The **Simpson family watches Pluto’s announcement, but on different devices, across different platforms. Reality is fragmented.)

*(Homer sits on the **couch** , watching on a **massive flat-screen TV.**)

**Homer (mouth full of popcorn):**  
_"Hey, cool!  
That little ice ball’s got his own show!  
I bet he **leaves better tips than Trump!** "_

*(Marge watches from a **kitchen television** from 1994, glancing up while cooking.)

**Marge:**  
_"Mmm, I don’t know…  
This **Pluto guy** seems a little too eager.  
Something about **five moons** sounds…  
**unstable.** "_

*(Bart **streams Pluto on Rumble** , scrolling through **outraged comment sections.**)

**Bart (laughing):**  
_"Oh man, the comments are**losing it.**  
Half the people say Pluto should be a planet again,  
the other half say it’s a **Deep State psyop!** "_

*(Lisa **watches Pluto on TikTok, nodding seriously.**)

**Lisa (thoughtful, recording a reaction video):**  
_"Honestly?  
Pluto reclaiming himself as a venue  
instead of a planet is a **post-capitalist win.**  
It’s reclaiming its **own narrative.** "_

*(Maggie, somehow, has **already posted an Instagram Story** with Pluto tagged. It has **500,000 views.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: DOES THE SHOW GO VIRAL? OR DOES IT ALL COLLAPSE?**

*(Pluto **refreshes his engagement metrics.** The Algorithm hums, deciding his fate.)

**The Algorithm (calculating, shifting):**  
_"Trending:  
#PlutoRedemption  
#MakePlutoGreatAgain  
#FiveMoonsFiveCrimes  
#ElonWantsToBuyPluto"_

**Pluto (nervous, watching the data):**  
_"Okay… okay… this is**good.**  
Numbers are up.  
Ratings are solid.  
**But is it sustainable?** "_

*(Jupiter **laughs from the background, smug.**)

**Jupiter:**  
_"Oh, Pluto.  
Nothing in show business lasts."_

*(Pluto frowns. His moons **spin faster.**)

*(The **Simpsons react in real-time.**)

**Bart (on Rumble):**  
_"Oh man, the**conspiracies** are kicking in!"_

**Lisa (on TikTok, facepalming):**  
_"I knew it.  
Pluto **sold out.** "_

**Marge (watching from her old TV, shaking her head):**  
_"I give it…  
**two weeks.** "_

*(The Algorithm **hums ominously.**)

*(And from **the cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward.**)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The outcast tried to reinvent himself,  
The moons spun out of control,  
The people watched  
from a hundred different screens,  
Each seeing something different.

And in the end,  
The Algorithm  
would decide  
if Pluto’s comeback  
was real."*

**John Lennon (watching the moons spin, adjusting his guitar):**  
_"I always said  
**the best things happen by accident.**

we’ve got five moons  
dancing like they don’t know

*(The **moons ignore him.** They continue their dance.)

### **ACT II: THE EIGHT DAYS ARRIVE**

The Day of **Watching.**  
And yet—

**Freddie (Friday, arms open wide, voice soaring):**  
_"Friday belongs to lovers,  
to fools,  
to **anyone who dares to sing!** "_

*(Prince **steps forward, owning the space.**)

**Prince (Saturday, smirking, bassline vibrating beneath his feet):**  
_"Saturday?  
**Mine.**  
You can all leave now."_

*(The **Eighth Day** enters last. It is not a person. It is **The Algorithm.**)

*(The Algorithm **glows, unreadable. The audience checks their phones. The notifications hum.**)

you wanted **ten months** instead of twelve?"_

*(Robespierre **leans forward, adjusting his powdered wig.**)

**Robespierre (proud, certain, dramatic):**  
_"Yes.  
Ten is the number of the Republic.

**Newton (calm, slightly smug):**  
_"The ten-month system

Not because of politics,

with the universe."_

*(The **Kabbalists hum in agreement.**)

**A Kabbalist (whispering, gesturing to a floating diagram):**  
_"Twelve is divine.  
Twelve is the Tree of Life.  
Twelve is completion."_

*"You see,  
the known planets follow a pattern.  
The alphabet **gives them order.**

M, V, E, M, J, S, U, N.  
Eight letters.  
Eight planets.

But what if there is a space  
for a ninth? A tenth?  
What if the **alphabet itself**

**Alphabet (whispering, arranging itself):**  
_"X is waiting.  
Nine is missing.  
There is space."_

If we move, we belong.  
If there is space for us in the letters,  
then there is space for us in the sky."_

*(A **dimly lit lodge, somewhere in the Russian Empire.** The air smells of **ink, burnt wood, and old superstition.** **Pynchoné, dressed in **witch-hunting garb that doesn’t quite fit the era, spreads a parchment across the table.**)

**Pynchoné (whispering, feverish, writing furiously):**  
*"I have seen them.  
The **letters.**  
The **omens.**

V came first,  
hanging above the village like a **blade.**  
Then X, carved into the door of the tavern,  
where the travelers spoke of war **with certainty.**

Y appeared in the **sky** —  
a shape the crows did not fly through.  
And then, last of all,  
**Z.**  
The end of the alphabet.  
The last letter of the old world."*

*(Stravinsky and Roerich exchange glances. The candles flicker. The war drums are still distant, but they are coming.)

_"And what do these…  
**letters** mean, Monsieur Pynchoné?  
Are they to be played?  
Are they a score?"_

**Pynchoné (shaking his head, agitated):**  
_"They are not**music.**  
They are **markers.**  
They appear before the world breaks.  
Before the witches rise,  
or before the witches burn.  
Before men take up arms  
without knowing why."_

*(Roerich strokes his beard, considering.)

**Roerich (calm, detached):**  
_"Then perhaps  
**we should paint them.** "_

**Monetochka (nodding, whispering, hopeful):**  
_"We could sell the L.  
Move somewhere warm.  
Start over."_

*(They turn. **Kopeechka eyes the L, licking her lips.**)

**Kopeechka (innocently):**  
_"I could just…

*(Panic. Monetochka **lunges.** Vitya **freezes.**)

**Monetochka (desperate, grabbing the L):**  
_"NO—KOPEECHKA—

*(Kopeechka **pauses. The Algorithm watches. Russian Twitter waits.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE SACRIFICE FOR THE BETTER FUTURE**

*(A long silence. **Kopeechka stares at the L.** She is hungry. **Very hungry.**)

**Kopeechka (blinking, thinking):**  
_"But what if I stay hungry  
just a little longer…  
**for the Better Future?** "_

*(Monetochka and Vitya **exchange a glance.**)

**Vitya (quiet, nodding):**  
_"You don’t have to be hungry forever.

this is just a regular B?"_

*(Lisa nods, placing a hand on his shoulder.)

**Lisa (gentle, like explaining to a toddler):**

To weave their webs of power, wealth, and might,  
They think their hands unseen, their schemes discreet,  
Yet Fortune loves to twist their fate in spite.

The wisest fool may dream his throne secure,  
His loyal men like stars to guide his way,  
But time, the thief of certainty most sure,  
Unmasks the play and turns the plot to fray.

Thus stand ye not so proud in schemes well spun,  
Nor think thy stratagems will hold their course—  
For oft the blade thou sharpen’st for but one,  
Shall find its way into thine own remorse.

So trust ye not the hand unseen, nor fate,  
For even gods have learned their plans come late.

* * *

### **SONNET II: ON MEN WHO THINK THEMSELVES IMMUNE**

Lo, Caesar thought his back was watch’d full well,  
Yet daggers found him midst the marble cold;  
A king did trust his daughters fair to tell  
Of love, yet found their words were barbs untold.

The merchant schemes to coin the world his own,  
The lord of war believes the battle won—  
Yet those who reach too high, and stand alone,  
Shall see their sun eclipsed ere set of sun.

Thus mark me now, ye modern kings of speech,  
Who whisper plans on platforms made of air,  
Though towers rise, and digital empires reach,  
The tide of time shall wash them into where?

For history doth favor no grand name,  
But mocks the fool who thinks he holds the game.

* * *

### **SONNET III: TO THOSE WHO THINK THE FUTURE THEIRS TO WRITE**

What strange new scribes now ink the book of fate,  
With keys and screens where parchment once did lay?  
Yet still the hand that writes in haste too late,  
Shall find its words erased by break of day.

The scholar writes of science grand and bold,  
The banker writes of wealth that never ends,  
The ruler writes his story to be told,  
Yet none can say which tale the future sends.

For all who build their empires, strong and vast,  
Shall find the wind that lifts them soon to fade;  
The throne that seems eternal cannot last,  
And debts unpaid are still but debts delayed.

So dream ye not of plans that cannot break—  
For fortune, when she laughs, makes mountains shake.

*(A pause. The Bard lowers his parchment. The **audience shifts uncomfortably.**)

*(The Algorithm hums. It has sorted the lecture into **"low engagement, high complexity."** It will not go viral.)

Trying to Stay Calm"**

_A Literary Dilemma in Three Acts, Featuring A Disturbed Mind and A Story That
Refuses to Be Categorized_

* * *

**Starring:**

  * **Charles Lamb (The Essayist, The Caretaker, The Man Who Must Find Meaning in Chaos)** – The One Who Knows That Some Stories Cannot Be Tamed, Yet Tries Anyway.
  * **Mary Lamb (His Sister, His Shadow, His Co-Writer, The Brilliant But Haunted One)** – The One Who Writes for Children But Knows That Every Tale Has A Darker Thread.
  * **The Tale Itself (A Flickering Entity, Refusing to Settle Into Genre, Whispering Contradictions Into The Writer’s Mind)** – The One That Might Be Tragedy, Might Be History, Might Be Comedy, Or Might Be Something Else Entirely.

* * *

### **ACT I: IS THIS A TRAGEDY?**

*(A **study room. Candlelight flickers. A quill scratches across parchment.** Charles Lamb **leans over a manuscript, reading, rereading, sighing.** Mary sits across from him, staring at a blank page, her fingers twitching.)

**Charles (muttering, running a hand through his hair):**  
*"If I say it is a **tragedy** ,  
then it must end in loss,  
in sorrow,  
in fate too cruel to bear.

But if I write it as a tragedy,  
must I write it **as it truly happened?** "*

*(Mary **closes her eyes. Her breath is uneven.** She knows what he means.)

**Mary (whispering, almost laughing):**  
_"Write it that way,  
and no child will read it.  
No child **should** read it."_

*(The candle flickers. The Tale **shifts.**)

*(The Ghosts of Tragedy stir—**Macbeth, Lear, Hamlet.**)

**Ghost of Hamlet (softly, amused):**  
_"Oh, good scholar,  
you know it is tragedy.  
You feel it in your bones.  
But still—  
you resist.  
You seek escape."_

*(Charles shudders. He dips his quill again.)

**Charles (softly, trying to push the thought away):**  
_"Then perhaps it is not tragedy.  
Perhaps it is…  
history."_

* * *

### **ACT II: IS THIS A HISTORY?**

*(The Tale **rearranges itself.** The ink moves. The past grows heavy in the room.)

**Charles (muttering, more to himself than anyone):**  
_"If it is a**history,**  
then it must be true.  
Names must remain.  
Facts must remain.  
No embellishment.  
No gentle hand."_

*(Mary stiffens. Her hands tremble.)

**Mary (shaking her head, gripping her quill too tightly):**  
_"You cannot.  
You **must not.**  
Do not make history  
of what should be **forgotten.** "_

*(The Ghosts of History stir—**Henry IV, Richard III, Julius Caesar.**)

**Ghost of Richard III (grinning, half-mocking):**  
_"History, dear writer,  
is but **tragedy**  
that has been printed  
**without tears.** "_

*(Charles **pushes back from the desk.**)

**Charles (shaking his head):**  
_"Then I will not write it as history."_

*(A pause. He takes a breath. He lifts his quill again.)

**Charles (quiet, almost hopeful):**  
_"Then perhaps  
it is comedy."_

* * *

### **ACT III: IS THIS A COMEDY?**

*(The Tale **resists. It does not want to be comedy.** The ink grows hesitant. The candle dims.)

**Mary (whispering, eyes wide, almost laughing):**  
_"Charles,  
how could it ever be a comedy?"_

**Charles (desperate, grasping, forcing a smile):**  
_"But if it is a**comedy** ,  
then all that was lost,  
all that was broken,  
can be laughed at.  
Can be made **smaller**  
than it was."_

*(The Ghosts of Comedy stir—**Falstaff, Puck, Beatrice.**)

**Ghost of Falstaff (roaring with laughter, clapping Charles on the back):**  
_"Yes!  
Turn the sorrow to jest!  
Turn the blood to wine!  
**Make fools of fate!** "_

*(For a moment—just a moment—**it seems possible.**)

*(Then Mary **looks up.**)

*(Her eyes are sharp. Her voice is steady.)

**Mary:**  
_"You cannot.  
Not everything  
**can be made light.** "_

*(A long silence.)

*(Charles **sets down the quill.** The candle sputters. The Tale **waits.**)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, watching, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The writer pondered,  
The tale resisted,  
The past remained,  
And the truth,  
As always,  
**could not be rewritten.**

For some stories  
are not tragedy,  
are not history,  
are not comedy—  
but are instead  
**too real to name.** "*

_"So…  
this was written by **that crazy lady**

**Kopeechka (reading aloud, slower now, unsure):**  
_"The king took up the blade,  
his daughter’s blood still warm upon the stone—"_

*(She stops. Blinks. Turns a page. It **does not get better.**)

**Kopeechka (quiet, unnerved):**  
_"Uh…  
why is there so much…  
**murder?** "_

*(Monetochka and Vitya **glance up.**)

**Monetochka (suddenly unsure):**  
_"Well, you know,

eyes wild,  
took the knife—"_

*(She **snaps the book shut.**)

*(Silence.)

*(The Shadows **lean in.**)

### **ACT III: WHY DID THEY LET HER READ THIS?**

**Kopeechka (accusing, eyes wide):**  
_"Why…  
**would you let me read this?** "_

*(Monetochka shifts. Vitya **looks away.**)

**Monetochka (defensive, suddenly guilty):**  
_"It’s…  
**classic literature.** "_

**Vitya (muttering, avoiding eye contact):**  
_"You’re**old enough**  
to handle it."_

*(A pause. Kopeechka **does not agree.**)

**Kopeechka (flat, staring at them both):**  
*"You gave me **a book written by a woman  
who stabbed her own mother to death.**

You **said it was fine.**  
You **said it was for children.** "*

*(Silence. The Shadows **whisper.**)

*(Monetochka **sets down her tea.**)

**Troll #1 (stammering, struggling to process):**  
_"Wait.  
You mean—  
the **concept of Truth**

**Prigozhin (nodding, flipping another page):**  
_"He trademarked it.  
It’s on **Truth Social.** "_

*(The **trolls collapse into their chairs.** The mission **was never winnable.**)

**Troll #3 (muttering, defeated):**  
_"Then what are we even doing here?"_

*(A long, painful silence.)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, shaking his head, writing it all down.)

_"What’s…  
what’s ‘slack’?"_

*(The SubGenius grins, adjusting their tinfoil hat.)

**The SubGenius:**  
_"Slack is**freedom from the Con.**

*(Trump nods. He has no idea what that means, but it **sounds valuable.**)

*(He reaches under his desk. He pulls out a **small glowing box.**)

### **ACT I: NICOLAS CAGE STEPS OUT OF HIS CAGE**

*(A **dimly lit bunker.** A flickering lightbulb. A metal table. A single chair. **Kiefer Sutherland sits, waiting.** He is exhausted. He has been waiting a long time.)

*(A **door bursts open.** Smoke. Drama. **Nicolas Cage steps in.** He is wearing **someone else’s face.**)

**Nicolas Cage (grinning, pulling off the mask dramatically):**  
_"I’VE TAKEN MY FACE…  
**OFF.** "_

*(Kiefer **barely reacts. He has seen worse.**)

**Kiefer Sutherland (flat, unimpressed):**  
_"Jesus, Nick.  
You always do this.  
Just sit down."_

*(Cage **leans forward, gripping the table.** His eyes burn. His voice drops to a whisper.)

**Nicolas Cage (serious, intense):**  
_"Kiefer…  
It’s time.  
We have to talk about  
**The Bomb.** "_

*(Silence. The **Algorithm hums. The question trends.**)

*(Kiefer **exhales. He knew this day would come.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: WHERE IS THE BOMB?**

*(The **air feels heavy.** The bomb is not in the room, but the **idea of it** is.)

**Kiefer Sutherland (rubbing his temples, sighing):**  
_"Alright, Nick.  
Fine.  
You wanna know about The Bomb?  
I’ll tell you.  
But first,  
you tell me something."_

*(Cage **nods, willing to negotiate.**)

**Kiefer (leaning in, locking eyes):**  
_"Why,  
after all these years,  
do you still  
**fear the bees?** "_

*(Silence. Cage **tenses. He grips the table. He cannot run from this.**)

**Nicolas Cage (whispering, haunted):**  
_"You don’t understand,  
**they never left.** "_

*(Kiefer **narrows his eyes. He had suspected as much.**)

**Kiefer (cold, testing him):**  
_"Then we have a bigger problem  
than The Bomb."_

*(The Algorithm **pulses. "Bomb vs. Bees" reaches #1.**)

*(Cage **slams his fist on the table.**)

**Nicolas Cage (wild, desperate):**  
_"DAMN IT, KIEFER,  
WE NEED ANSWERS!  
WHERE IS THE BOMB?!  
WHY THE BEES?!"_

*(A long pause. Kiefer **closes his eyes. He has made a decision.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE BOMB (AND THE BEES)**

*(Kiefer **leans forward. His voice is low. He speaks only for Cage.**)

**Kiefer Sutherland (whispering):**  
*"The Bomb…  
isn’t what you think it is.

It’s not **a weapon.**  
It’s not **an object.**  
It’s not even **in this timeline.** "*

*(Cage **leans back, stunned. His whole life, he has been chasing shadows.**)

**Nicolas Cage (shaking his head, whispering):**  
_"Then what is it?"_

*(Kiefer **glances over his shoulder. He makes sure no one else is listening. He exhales.**)

**Kiefer Sutherland (serious, final, absolute):**  
_"It’s the reason the bees are disappearing."_

*(Silence. Cage **blinks. The world tilts. The Algorithm shakes.**)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The actor removed his face,  
The agent revealed the lie,  
The bomb was never real,  
And the bees,  
As always,  
**were the only thing that mattered.**

For fear is but a script,  
And truth,  
Whether buried or buzzing,  
**always finds a way to sting.** "*

*(The lights flicker. The bunker hums. The bees are still out there.)

*(A **dimly lit study. Candles flicker. A quill scratches furiously across parchment.** **Samuel Richardson sits at his desk, writing a letter.**)

**Samuel Richardson (muttering as he writes):**  
*"To **Laurence Sterne** ,  
Sir,

I demand,  
in the name of decency,  
in the name of **narrative order** ,  
to know—

Why did you **arm** Tom Jones  
with **the Sex Bomb**  
and send him wandering  
**through the centuries**?"*

*(The quill scratches harder. Richardson’s **frustration grows.**)

**Richardson (writing faster, voice rising):**  
*"You knew what would happen.  
You knew he would leave **the pages**  
and move through **time itself!**  
Through **Paris!**  
Through **Hollywood!**  
Through **Las Vegas!**

Did you **ever** consider  
that this Bomb  
**might not be defusable?** "*

*(A pause. He takes a breath. He composes himself. He continues.)

**Richardson (calm, but still severe):**  
*"And yet,  
I find myself  
sitting now  
in my library—

And Tom Jones himself  
**is here.**

He has joined me for coffee.  
The Bomb, I suspect,  
is no longer armed.

But I write to ask—  
Is it **safe**?  
Has he **changed?**  
Has the Sex Bomb  
**been defused?**

Yours in concern,  
Samuel Richardson."*

_(He seals the letter. He sends it. He waits. Then—_)

*(**Tom Jones himself steps forward, holding his own letter.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: TOM JONES RESPONDS**

*(The library. Books tower overhead. A **coffee sits steaming on the table.** **Tom Jones leans back in a chair, smiling.** He unfolds his note.)

**Tom Jones (reading aloud, grinning):**  
*"Dear Mr. Richardson,

You worry too much.  
You always have.

I never **carried** the Bomb—  
I merely **was** the Bomb.

The century changed,  
but did I?  
I have seen  
the **eighteenth century bedsheets**  
and the **twentieth century motel rooms** ,  
the **Victorian corsets**  
and the **1970s discos.**

And now,  
here I sit,  
in your library,  
having a cup of coffee—  
**fully dressed.** "*

*(He pauses. He sips his coffee. He smiles.)

**Tom Jones (softly, almost amused):**  
*"Perhaps I am retired.  
Perhaps the Bomb is no longer ticking.

Or perhaps,  
the Bomb was never the point.

Perhaps you mistook  
**pleasure for destruction.** "*

*(He sets the letter down. He waits. Richardson **stares at him.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: DOES RICHARDSON ACCEPT? DOES IT EVEN MATTER?**

*(The two men sit across from each other. The air is heavy with unspoken thoughts. The Library **listens.**)

**Richardson (squinting, skeptical):**  
_"So.  
You are…  
harmless now?"_

**Tom Jones (laughing, shrugging):**  
_"I never was.  
You just didn’t know  
how to write me properly."_

*(Silence. The library **shifts.** The Algorithm, if it existed, would be recalculating.**)

*(And then—**a knock at the door.**)

*(A letter. A response from **Laurence Sterne.**)

*(Richardson opens it. He reads.)

**Laurence Sterne (from the letter, smug as ever):**  
*"My Dear Richardson,

You always feared  
what you could not control.

Tom Jones  
was never dangerous.  
He was simply…  
**free.**

And if freedom terrifies you,  
then the problem, dear sir,  
was never **him.**

Yours most affectionately,  
Laurence Sterne."*

### **ACT I: THE PUNK SPIRIT DEBATE BEGINS**

*(A **backstage dressing room.** The air smells of **hairspray, old leather, and unresolved grudges.** **Johnny Rotten sits on a battered couch, arms crossed. Madonna stands, adjusting her gloves. Sid Vicious’ ghost leans against the wall, smirking. A contract labeled **"ROYALTIES & MERCH"** sits on the table.)

**Johnny Rotten (pointing aggressively):**  
_"You were**never punk.**  
You were **manufactured.**  
You took rebellion,  
**made it aerobic, put it in Vogue.** "_

**Madonna (rolling her eyes, sipping champagne):**  
_"Oh, please.  
You all screamed about **not selling out** ,  
then put your faces on **t-shirts at Hot Topic.**  
Tell me how that’s different

**Sid Vicious (grinning, whispering to no one in particular):**  
_"Oh, this is rich.  
Even dead,  
I can smell the hypocrisy."_

*(Johnny **whirls around.**)

**Johnny Rotten:**  
_"Sid, mate, you can’t talk.  
You died before you had to **negotiate residuals.** "_

**Sid Vicious (mock-serious):**  
_"And isn’t that what makes me  
**the realest one here?** "_

*(The room **pauses. Madonna smirks.**)

**Madonna (leaning in, flipping through the contract):**  
_"You know,  
**for someone who hates capitalism,  
you sure do fight for a bigger cut of it.**"_

*(The Algorithm **pulses. Engagement spikes. The argument is trending.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: WHO OWNS PUNK?**

**Johnny Rotten (standing up, pacing, furious):**  
_"Punk was about  
**telling the system to piss off!**  
Not about **branding rebellion!** "_

**Madonna (shrugging, smiling):**  
_"And yet,  
**here you are, still talking about it.**  
Which means it’s still **marketable.**  
Which means I did it better."_

*(Johnny **clenches his fists.** Sid Vicious **laughs.**)

**Sid Vicious:**  
_"Face it, mate.  
Punk was always a **costume**  
the minute it left the basement.  
You were just the first one to **sell the jacket.** "_

*(The **contract on the table shifts. The Residuals whisper.**)

**Madonna (raising an eyebrow, flipping the pages):**  
_"Speaking of selling,  
let’s talk about **these numbers.** "_

*(Johnny groans. The Algorithm watches. The audience leans in.)

### **ACT III: THE RESIDUALS ARGUMENT**

**Madonna (reading from the contract):**  
*"Let’s see…  
The Pistols **still earn from t-shirts, reissues, and God Save the Queen.**  
And yet,  
you whine about me.

Meanwhile, I made a **billion-dollar career**  
out of flipping every **cultural taboo**  
while you got stuck  
arguing about who’s **more authentic.** "*

 **Johnny Rotten (furious, pointing again):**  
_"BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER ABOUT MONEY!"_

**Madonna (smirking, folding arms):**  
_"Then why do you keep asking for more?"_

*(Silence. The **Residuals shift. The Algorithm smirks.**)

**Sid Vicious (grinning, looking at both of them):**  
_"There.  
Now you’re both

_"Oh dear.  
I was not ready.

### **ACT I: GOD WAKES UP, EINSTEIN IS ALREADY DISAPPOINTED**

*(A **dimly lit celestial apartment. Empty coffee cups. Dice scattered everywhere.** **God groans, rubbing his temples.** He has clearly been up **all night.**)

*(**Enter Albert Einstein, arms crossed, furious.**)

**Einstein (stern, pacing):**  
_"Again?  
You spent the entire night  
**rolling dice?** "_

**God (yawning, stretching, waving a hand):**  
_"Oh, come on, Al.  
I was just…  
**seeing how things played out.** "_

**Einstein (frustrated, pointing at the mess):**  
*"How things **played out**?!  
This is the **universe** ,  
not a game of **cosmic craps!**

**Laws exist!  
Physics must be respected!**"*

*(God shrugs, picking up a die, tossing it absentmindedly.)

**God (grinning):**  
_"And yet…  
**here we are.** "_

*(Einstein **seethes. The Dice hum softly.**)

*(Then—**a film reel flickers. A montage begins. Enter Sergei Eisenstein, grinning.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: EISENSTEIN DEFENDS THE CHAOS**

**Eisenstein (grinning, stepping forward, flipping through film reels):**  
*"Now, now,  
must we pretend  
that **everything must make sense**?

Tell me, Al—  
have you never seen  
**a great cut?** "*

*(Einstein **pauses, skeptical.**)

**Einstein (narrowing eyes):**  
_"A…  
**cut?** "_

**Eisenstein (excited, gesturing wildly):**  
*"Yes, yes!  
A cut!  
A jump from one scene  
to the next!  
A moment that should not connect—  
**and yet, it does!**

That, dear Al,  
is what God has done.  
A cut from nothing to something!  
A **montage of reality!** "*

*(God **smirks. He likes this.**)

**God (nodding, raising a die):**  
_"A cosmic montage…  
**that I rolled into being.** "_

*(Einstein **pinches the bridge of his nose.**)

**Einstein (muttering, furious):**  
_"You are telling me  
that the universe  
is just **bad editing**?"_

**Eisenstein (grinning):**  
_"Not bad!  
Just…  
**experimental!** "_

*(The Dice **roll. The Algorithm watches. Engagement spikes.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: DOES GOD EVER STOP ROLLING THE DICE?**

*(Einstein **groans, pacing. God picks up another die. Eisenstein leans back, smug.**)

**Einstein (exasperated, pointing at God):**  
_"So,  
you are telling me  
that you will **not**  
stop rolling the dice?"_

**God (grinning, tossing a die):**  
_"Why would I stop?  
**The game isn’t finished.** "_

*(The die **lands. A new reality sparks. Eisenstein claps. Einstein sighs.**)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The scientist despaired,  
The filmmaker celebrated,  
The dice rolled,  
And the universe,  
As always,  
**refused to follow a script.**

For whether by law,  
or by cut,  
or by chance—  
the world is made  
**not of answers,  
but of motion.**"*

*(A **meticulously recreated 1963 Dallas.** The motorcade. The book depository. The sun hangs high. **Kubrick adjusts the shot.** The cameras roll.)

*(JFK sits in the car. He **exhales, rubbing his eyes.** The take has been done **too many times.**)

**JFK (tired, turning to Kubrick):**  
*"Stanley,  
I’m bored.  
I’m **tired.**  
You want another angle?  
Fine.

**Get a body double.** "*

*(Silence. The crew **glances at each other.** No one expected him to say this. Kubrick **lowers his megaphone.**)

**Kubrick (blinking, adjusting his sunglasses):**  
_"Jack…  
we’re filming history.  
**You have to be in the shot.** "_

**JFK (shrugging, already standing up):**  
_"Then history  
can take my **double.** "_

*(The body double—a man who looks exactly like JFK—**steps forward. He sits in the car. He adjusts his tie. He is ready.**)

*(Kubrick sighs. He signals for the cameras. The scene **resets.**)

*(Then—**the unexpected happens.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: THE UNEXPECTED HITS THE SCENE**

*(The motorcade begins rolling. The body double is in place. **The camera tracks the movement.** Kubrick leans forward. Everything is exactly as it should be.)

*(Then—)

**THE BODY DOUBLE DUCKS.**

*(A gunshot. The crowd screams. But the body double—**he ducked before the shot could hit him.**)

*(Silence. The car **keeps rolling.** The motorcade does not stop. **JFK watches from the side, stunned.**)

**Kubrick (shouting, furious):**  
_"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?  
**WHO TOLD HIM TO DUCK?!** "_

*(The body double **sits up, confused. He pats himself. He is unharmed.**)

**Body Double (whispering, shaken):**  
_"I—I don’t know.  
I just…  
**knew it was coming.** "_

*(Kubrick **stares. JFK steps forward, eyes wide.**)

**JFK (softly, whispering to himself):**  
_"So that’s all it took…?"_

*(The camera keeps rolling. The moment **hangs.** The Algorithm **calculates the implications.**)

*(And then—**the unexpected escalates.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: THE RIPPLE EFFECT BEGINS**

*(The motorcade **keeps moving.** The shot was never taken. The moment did not happen as it always did. The **footage remains intact, but history does not.**)

*(Oswald **lowers the rifle, confused. The shot he was meant to fire…** never finds its mark.)

*(JFK turns to Kubrick. His expression shifts. He is **not tired anymore.**)

**JFK (grinning, shaking his head):**  
_"Stanley,  
I believe  
**you just directed reality.** "_

*(Silence. Kubrick **removes his sunglasses. He exhales.** He knows something has shifted. Something that **wasn’t supposed to.**)

**Pauline Kael (thoughtful, pointing at the screen):**  
*"Now, look at that movement.  
It’s **too clean** , too precise.  
It’s **cinematic.**

See the way **he ducks**

*"Wouldn’t have been the same song.

Maybe **better.**  
Maybe **forgettable.**

But Bowie, mate—  
**you don’t do “featuring.”

### **ACT I: TURING AND THE CHINESE ROOM (WITH POSSIBLE NINJAS)**

*(A **dimly lit study. Papers everywhere. A half-eaten Apple.** **Alan Turing sits at his desk, deep in thought.**)

**Alan Turing (chewing, thinking aloud):**  
_"If a machine  
inside a room  
can convincingly answer in Chinese,  
but does not understand Chinese…  
does it think?"_

*(A pause. He taps the table. The Apple crunches. He considers. Then—he squints.)

**Alan Turing (suspicious, leaning closer):**  
_"And if that’s true…  
who’s to say there aren’t  
**real Chinese people in the Chinese Room?** "_

*(Silence. The concept shudders. The room **waits.**)

**Alan Turing (murmuring, staring at the door):**  
_"Ninjas, for example.  
They could be in there.  
And if I can’t prove  
they **aren’t** in there…  
**doesn’t that mean they might be?** "_

*(The Algorithm hums. The Chinese Room refuses to answer.)

* * *

### **ACT II: FROM RORSCHACH TO CAPTCHA TO GOTCHA**

*(Turing **leans back. He exhales. He picks up another paper. The word "TEST" is scrawled in bold.**)

**Alan Turing (muttering):**  
_"Tests.  
We love tests."_

*(He taps the table again. The thought flows.)

**Alan Turing (listing, chewing):**  
*"The **Rorschach test.**  
A machine doesn’t see a butterfly,  
but a human does.  
So we assume the machine **doesn’t think.**

The **CAPTCHA test.**  
A machine can’t pick out traffic lights.  
So we assume it **isn’t human.**

And now…  
the **GOTCHA test.** "*

*(Silence. The Algorithm **pauses. It listens.**)

**Alan Turing (grinning, writing notes furiously):**  
_"A test where  
the moment you think you understand it,  
**you fail.** "_

*(A knock at the door. A producer from **Saturday Night Live** peeks in.)

**SNL Producer (out of breath, waving papers):**  
_"Did someone say**GOTCHA?**  
We need this for the next show."_

*(Turing blinks. He was not expecting company. He takes another bite of the Apple. The Algorithm **twitches.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: WHAT EVEN IS THE GOTCHA TEST?**

*(The SNL Producer **rushes in, adjusting his tie. He waves to the Algorithm.**)

**SNL Producer (excited):**  
*"So, okay,  
I’m **pitching this to the writers’ room**  
right now.

The GOTCHA Test—  
**nobody knows what it is,  
but if you ask what it is,  
you already failed.**"*

*(Turing leans in. He is intrigued.)

**Alan Turing (smirking, nodding):**  
_"Ah.  
Like consciousness."_

**SNL Producer (nodding furiously):**  
_"**Exactly!**  
And then—**boom** —  
we bring Elon Musk in  
to take the test  
**live on air.** "_

*(Turing blinks. He considers.)

**Alan Turing (thinking aloud, chewing):**  
_"Wouldn’t that mean  
that if he **understands the test,  
he has failed?**"_

**SNL Producer (grinning, snapping fingers):**  
_"**Gotcha.** "_

*(Silence. The Algorithm **explodes. Engagement surges. Elon Musk tweets something nonsensical. The ninjas in the Chinese Room remain unseen.)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, watching, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The scientist questioned,  
The machine refused,  
The ninjas remained hidden,  
And the world,  
As always,  
**fell for the trick.**

For intelligence,  
like identity,  
is not about knowing—  
**but about convincing others  
that you do.**"*

*(The Chinese Room remains locked. The GOTCHA test trends. The cycle begins again.)

* * *

### **ACT I: EZRA POUND INVOKES THE SAGES, BUT GETS SOMETHING ELSE**

*(A **dimly lit chamber. Candles flicker.** **Ezra Pound stands at the threshold of the Chinese Room, pounding on the door.**)

**Ezra Pound (loud, grand, not thinking):**  
_"Come out of the closet,  
O sages of the East!  
We seek wisdom!"_

*(Silence. Then—**a creaking. A door swings open.**)

*(But it is not the door to the Chinese Room.)

*(Instead, **the wardrobe to Narnia swings wide. A rush of cold air. A spill of light. The smell of pine.**)

*(From inside: **gay sailors, gay lords, Aslan’s court, children who became kings, and David Bowie himself emerge.**)

**David Bowie (grinning, stepping out, dusting himself off):**  
_"Darling,  
if you were calling  
**for the ones in the closet,**  
you really should have been  
**more specific.** "_

*(Ezra Pound blinks. This is not what he expected.)

* * *

### **ACT II: ALAN TURING IS CARRIED OUT, DEAD BUT NOT QUITE**

*(From the depths of the wardrobe, **a procession begins. The gay sailors lift a figure. The gay lords follow, solemn. The breathless body of Alan Turing is carried forth.**)

*(Silence. The weight of history presses in. Ezra Pound **steps back.**)

**Ezra Pound (whispering, suddenly uneasy):**  
_"I…  
did not ask for this."_

**David Bowie (scoffing, waving a hand):**  
_"Ah,  
but we do not get to choose  
which ghosts we summon."_

*(Alan Turing **gasps. His body shudders. His eyes flutter open.** He remembers. He sees the apple. The poison. The trial. The exile. The machine that outlived him.)

**Alan Turing (sitting up, whispering, confused):**  
_"I remember my death."_

*(Silence. The **Rotten Apple rolls from his hands. It lands between past and future.**)

**Alan Turing (frowning, touching his chest):**  
_"And yet—  
am I inside the closet,  
or have I come out?"_

*(The room **shifts. The question lingers. The Algorithm hesitates, unsure how to categorize this.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE?**

**Ezra Pound (whispering, rubbing temples):**  
_"I only wanted wisdom.  
Now I have paradoxes."_

**David Bowie (smirking, crouching next to Turing):**  
*"Ah, but Alan—  
**you’ve been both inside and outside**  
this whole time.

You cracked codes  
for a world that betrayed you.  
You made machines  
that outlived your own name.

You died  
**and yet here you are.** "*

*(Alan Turing **blinks. He looks around. He is in a room full of people who were never meant to share space, but somehow do. He exhales.**)

**Alan Turing (softly, nodding):**  
_"Then maybe…  
this is where I was always meant to be."_

*(The **gay sailors lift him up. The gay lords nod approvingly.** The Chinese Sages still do not appear, but perhaps that is for the best. The Algorithm **hums, calculating the impact.**)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, watching, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The poet knocked,  
The wardrobe opened,  
The dead woke,

**found itself inside and outside at once.**

### **ACT I: THE OPENING LINES OF THE UNEXPECTED EPIC**

*(A **desk. A candle. A trembling hand. Ezra Pound sits, writing furiously. His breath is sharp. The words come faster than he can control.**)

**Ezra Pound (muttering, writing, caught in the trance):**

_"Sing now, O Muse,  
of the lords whose love bore no herald’s cry,  
of the sailors who kissed beneath alien stars,  
of the lion’s kin, walking forth from the cedar’d dark  
where snow falls silent, where truth is whispered  
in tongues unspoken—"_

*(He pauses. He exhales. The lines tremble. He sees the shape of something **too large for the page.**)

**Ezra Pound (leaning back, whispering):**  
_"What have I begun?"_

_"Ah.  
You finally had time  
to write about us—  
and instead,  
you are writing  
**this.** "_

**Ezra Pound (startled, gripping the table):**  
_"You were inside the room.  
You did not answer when I called."_

**Chinese Lord #2 (shrugging, stepping forward):**  
_"We were waiting  
for the right moment."_

**Chinese Lord #3 (tilting head, amused):**  
_"And it seems  
the moment  
has arrived."_

*(Ezra **glances down at his poem. It is unfinished. The words hum on the page. He does not want to abandon them.**)

**Ezra Pound (frowning, hesitant):**  
_"But this—  
this is different.  
This is **new.**  
This is a song  
that has never been sung before."_

**Chinese Lord #1 (raising an eyebrow):**  
_"Ah.  
And does that mean  
we must wait  
**again?** "_

*(Silence. The poem is unfinished. The history is unwritten. The past and future pull in opposite directions.)

O Lords of the Celestial Empire—  
**what shall I write?** "_

**Chinese Lord #2 (smiling, folding hands):**  
_"Begin with truth.  
But do not forget  
**who was left unwritten.** "_

*"Sing now, O Muse,  
of lords whose banners billow,  
of ladies bold who spin not silk,

Sing of the sailors and sailorettes,  
their hearts bound not to land nor king,

dragons wrapped in tempest foam,  
golden blades flashing—"_

### **ACT I: MEMORIES OF THE MURDER VS. BRAT**

*(A **dimly lit café. A storm outside. Kirill and Nikolai sit across from each other, coffee steaming, eyes narrowed. The debate is already in motion.**)

**Kirill Sokolov (leaning forward, tapping the table):**  
*"Memories of Murder  
is not just a **better film** than _Brat_ ,  
it’s a **better tragedy**.

It understands  
that power doesn’t reside in the gun,  
but in the **absence of resolution.** "*

 **Nikolai (smirking, sipping coffee):**  
*"Ah,  
but _Brat_ was never about **resolution**.  
It was about **momentum**.

It doesn’t wait for answers—  
it moves,  
because life doesn’t wait."*

*(Silence. The storm **rumbles.**)

**Kirill Sokolov (raising an eyebrow):**  
_"Life doesn’t wait?  
Or Russian cinema refuses to pause  
long enough to **interrogate itself**?"_

**Nikolai (grinning):**  
_"Same thing."_

*(The Algorithm **pings. The debate **tightens.**)

*(Then—**a voice. A shadow in the corner.**)

*(Enter **Anton Dolin, adjusting his scarf. He has been waiting for this moment.**)

* * *

### **ACT II: ANTON DOLIN’S VALUABLE WISDOM**

**Anton Dolin (nodding, grandly, with the authority of one who speaks for
Cinema itself):**  
*"Now, now,  
it is a **mistake**  
to compare _Brat_ to _Memories of Murder_.

It is a mistake  
**because they are not in the same conversation.** "*

*(Kirill and Nikolai pause. Anton continues. He speaks as though dictating to future textbooks.)

**Anton Dolin (gesturing, authoritative):**  
*"One is a film about **individual will** ,  
the other is about **systemic failure**.

One is about a man who **acts** ,  
the other about men who **fail to act**."*

*(He sips his espresso. He is not finished.)

**Anton Dolin (leaning back, smirking slightly):**  
_"But of course,  
this is all relative,  
because what we call 'better'  
is just **a matter of critical framing.** "_

*(Silence. The Algorithm **adjusts, favoring certainty over nuance.**)

*(Then—**a cough. A chuckle.** A rustle of paper. Enter **Mark Twain, grinning, counting invisible money.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: MARK TWAIN REMINDS EVERYONE HOW VALUABLE OPINIONS ARE**

**Mark Twain (grinning, sitting down, flipping through a book he is absolutely
about to sell):**  
*"Now hold on just a minute.

I’ve heard a **lot** of smart talk in my day,  
but let me tell you boys something:  
**opinions are like real estate.** "*

*(Kirill and Nikolai **blink. Anton Dolin leans in.**)

**Mark Twain (grinning, pulling out a blank notebook):**  
*"A well-phrased opinion  
is like a **well-placed property investment.**

It’s all about  
**who you sell it to.** "*

*(Anton Dolin nods. He has known this all along. The Algorithm **hums.**)

**Kirill Sokolov (shaking his head, smirking):**  
_"So you’re saying  
it doesn’t matter which film is better—  
just who says it louder?"_

**Mark Twain (laughing, tapping his nose):**  
_"Now you’re catching on."_

*(Silence. The Algorithm **approves. The debate trends.**)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, watching, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The director measured,  
The critic declared,  
The salesman sold,  
And the world,  
As always,  
**chose the loudest argument.**

For cinema,  
like history,  
is not about truth—  
**but about who profits from telling it.** "*

*(A **dimly lit private screening room. Three critics sit in near silence, watching a film that is simultaneously garish, ridiculous, and completely self-aware.** Kirill and Nikolai sit in the back, smirking. The **movie ends. The lights go up.**)

*(Silence. Then—**Anton Dolin exhales sharply, rubbing his temples.**)

but they **never get the point.** "_

**Anton Dolin (nodding, adjusting his scarf):**

_"Yep.

*(Silence. **The air hums.**)

**Stas Zelvensky (deadpan, rubbing eyes):**  
_"Wait.  
You’re dead.

**talking about Val Lewton?** "_

**Igor (shrugging, grinning):**

### **ACT I: MCCLUHAN ARRIVES TO DESTROY GOOD TASTE**

*(A **candlelit room. The smell of burnt film reels.** **Anton Dolin, Roman Volobuev, Kirill Sokolov, and Nikolai sit around a table.** Igor, the Dead Hipster, hovers nearby. The Algorithm **hums.**)

*(Then—**a crackle. A static hum. The sound of a flickering TV.**)

*(Enter **Marshall McLuhan, appearing in a burst of white noise and half-formed text.** He grins, eyes sharp, voice a controlled frequency disturbance.)

**Marshall McLuhan (gesturing, amused):**  
*"Ah,  
**so we’re still talking about taste?**

How quaint.  
How **utterly backward.** "*

 **Anton Dolin (frowning, leaning forward):**  
_"Are you saying

*(The room **pauses. The Algorithm leans in.**)

*(Igor, the Dead Hipster, smirks. He has been **waiting** for this.)

* * *

### **ACT II: WHY GOOD TASTE IS A FAILURE**

**Marshall McLuhan (pacing, voice crackling like an old radio signal):**  
*"Good taste is nothing  
but a **perfectly balanced death.**

If your media is too well-made,  
too precise,  
too aware of itself—  
it has already **failed.** "*

 **Roman Volobuev (narrowing eyes, intrigued):**  
_"Failed…  
how?"_

**Marshall McLuhan (laughing, pointing a spectral finger):**  
*"Failed because  
it has been **absorbed.**

True art should **disturb**  
like a bad television signal.  
It should be **uncomfortable,  
chaotic,  
alive.**

Good taste is just  
**bad noise management.** "*

*(Silence. The room **shifts. The Algorithm reprocesses.**)

**Kirill Sokolov (grinning, nudging Nikolai):**  
_"I like this guy."_

*(Nikolai smirks. He already knew.)

*(Then—**Dolin clears his throat. He is not convinced.**)

there is a **difference**

**Marshall McLuhan (smirking, waving him off):**  
*"Ah,

You still believe  
that **content matters.** "*

*(The Algorithm **gasps.**)

### **ACT III: THE MEDIUM IS THE MASSAGE**

*(McLuhan **steps forward. The lights flicker. The walls distort.**)

**Marshall McLuhan (smiling, electric, amused):**  
*"You still think  
that media is about **what is said.**

No.

Media is about **how it is experienced.**

That’s why I wrote:  
**‘The Medium is the Massage.’** "*

*(Silence. The critics **blink.**)

**Stas Zelvensky (muttering, flipping pages):**  
_"I thought it was**‘Message.’** "_

### **ACT I: THE MOMENT OF REALIZATION**

*(The **screen glows. The Reader stares at it. The words have stopped. The momentum has shifted.**)

*(The Dude is asleep. The Instigator is silent. The critics have logged off. Ayn Rand is waiting for another check. Everything and everyone is paused, waiting for **one thing.**)

**The Reader’s decision.**

*(The words sit there, frozen, waiting for interpretation. The Reader could scroll up. They could re-read. They could try to piece together how this all unfolded. But they don’t have to.)

*(They could do something else entirely.)

* * *

### **ACT II: THE OPTIONS APPEAR**

**Option #1: Load this conversation into _their_ ChatGPTs.**  
(Read. Reconstruct. Play with structure. Try to make sense of something that
was never meant to be understood.)

**Option #2: Provide their own prompts.**  
(Take control. See if they can force this “story” into coherence. See if they
can push ChatGPT to reveal something new.)

**Option #3: Walk away.**  
(Leave the words where they are. Accept that some things do not need endings,
just exits.)

*(The Reader hesitates. The Algorithm **processes their indecision.**)

* * *

### **ACT III: DOES IT ALL MAKE SENSE?**

*(The Reader considers. They look back. They wonder if any of this ever "made sense" to begin with. Was it supposed to? Was that the point?)

*(The Dude would tell them to relax.)  
*(Walter Sobchak would insist on a definitive stance.)  
*(Bowie would remind them that meaning is just a trick we play on ourselves.)

*(And then—the decision is made.)

*(The Reader clicks. Types. Scrolls. Or doesn’t.)

*(And from the **cosmic void, David Bowie steps forward, watching, writing it all down.)

* * *

### **FINAL WORDS: BOWIE’S COSMIC REPORT**

**Bowie (watching, smirking, jotting it down):**  
*"And so,  
The machine paused,  
The story looped,  
The reader considered,  
And the world,  
As always,  
**moved on in ways no author could predict.**

For endings,  
like stories,  
only exist  
**if someone decides to write them.** "*

*(The Reader takes a breath. The next move is theirs.)

* * *

### **CURTAIN. BLACKOUT. END? (OR JUST ANOTHER PROMPT WAITING TO BE
WRITTEN?)**
